&lt;p&gt;Attending regional conferences is one of the most exciting parts of my job. I always leave with so much inspiration from the work of the many amazing scholars across the country. This year, the Southern States Communication Association conference was held in Nashville from April 5th through April 8th, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t even have to leave the state!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things about the SSCA conferences is its relaxed atmosphere and the opportunity to engage with so many welcoming people. Below is a summary of my professional activities at the conference, as well as links to all files used in the presentations I gave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tennessee-promise-panel&#34;&gt;Tennessee Promise Panel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;100%&#34; src=&#34;https://kurtisdmiller.com/img/conference/IMG_20180405_134501.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photograph of the members of the panel&#34; title=&#34;Brad Bailey, Jennifer James, Karen Johnson, Katelyn Brooks, Leonard Assante, and Scott Christen&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presented as part of a panel of scholars discussing the impact of Tennessee Promise, a program designed to create &amp;ldquo;free community college&amp;rdquo; for students in Tennessee. We had the opportunity to discuss both the intended and unintended consequences of the program at a variety of institutions, including community colleges, 4-year public institutions, and 4-year private institutions. We were especially lucky to be placed in two back-to-back slots in the program for this discussion, which was lively and interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was honored to participate as the only representative of a private institution and the only representative of a small liberal-arts college. A special shout-out to Leonard Assante, Katelyn Brooks, Scott Christen, Jennifer James, Karen Johnson, Malcolm McAvoy, and Patrick Richey for their contributions to the panel, and to Brad Bailey for Chairing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gifts&#34;&gt;GIFTS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a fantastic time presenting on a GIFTS panel! I presented a Great Idea For Teaching Students (GIFTS) titled &lt;em&gt;Slides Against Humanity&lt;/em&gt; in Session I. A special shout out to Doug Pruim for being the co-author on this presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so proud that I had the opportunity to work together with so many wonderful scholars to put together a panel on providing effective feedback at the 2018 Southern States Communication Association Conference. I organized a panel titled &lt;em&gt;Musings on Instructor Feedback: Improving the Process and Quality of Feedback&lt;/em&gt; which came out of a series of conversations at the 2017 Tennessee Communication Association conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My contribution to the panel was titled &lt;em&gt;Hashtag Feedback: Using Text Expansion to Streamline the Process of Providing Detailed Effective Feedback&lt;/em&gt;. A special shout out to Jacob Metz, L&amp;rsquo;Oreal Stephens, and Karen Johnson for their contributions to the panel, and to Brad Bailey for stepping in at the last minute to Chair in addition to preparing his own contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Andrew Johnson Debate Team at Tusculum had another strong showing over the Easter weekend. Alex Rolison (Senior, Museum Studies) and River Donnelly (Sophomore, Psychology) finished in 5th place at the 12th annual Spring Sensation tournament at Northeast State Community College in Blountville, TN. There were 13 pairings representing 6 schools at this competition. Alex and River had only one loss during the round-robin portion of the tournament, but finished just outside the top four pairings, who went on to the elimination phase of the tournament. This is a very impressive finish considering that this tournament is only the second competition since the club was founded this Spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Andrew Johnson Debate Team at Tusculum competed in the Tennessee Valley Invitational at Pellissippi State Community College in Knoxville on Saturday, February 24th. This multi-state tournament was the debut event for competitive debate at Tusculum, and included over 40 students from across the region. Our team of Evan Altizer and Alex Rolison made a successful debut in the novice division, and received several compliments from competitors and coaches at established programs. The team was very competitive in the round-robin portion of the tournament. During the round robin the team made a strong showing against several other teams, including narrow losses to the teams which went on to win 1st and 2nd in the division.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing Professional Emails</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Engaging in professional communication with your professor is a good habit and it helps ensure that they have a good impression of you. Many students have difficulty using email effectively. If you are having trouble figuring out how to put together an email to your professor, you can&amp;rsquo;t go wrong with the template below. Whether you are in my class or any other class at the college, this template should work well. I have also included an example email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;addressing-and-header-information&#34;&gt;Addressing and Header Information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;From:&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;Your official school email address.&lt;/dd&gt; 
  &lt;dt&gt;To:&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;Your professor&#39;s email address, as listed in the syllabus.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Cc:&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&#34;Carbon Copy&#34; - list anyone else you want to see your email, such as an advisor or coach. A good &#34;rule of thumb&#34; is to Cc anyone you mention in the email.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Bcc:&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&#34;Blind Carbon Copy&#34; – like Cc, but without letting the person you are sending the email to know that you have included other people. A good &#34;rule of thumb&#34; is NOT to use Bcc in most situations. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Some email systems do not keep Bcc blind, letting the person in the &#34;To&#34; field see all recipients.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Subject:&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;Start with your class and section. Then write the topic from &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; perspective. &#34;Class&#34; makes a terrible subject, because your professor teaches many classes and nearly all student emails are about one of those classes in some way.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;email-template&#34;&gt;Email Template&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace the information in brackets below as appropriate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject: [class number and section]: [your issue]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear [Title, use &amp;ldquo;Professor&amp;rdquo; to be safe if you do not know] [Last Name],&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in your [time] [class name] class on [days class meets]. I have checked the [syllabus/assignment instructions/rubric/textbook/class resources] for an answer, but it does not adequately answer my question. I need some additional help with [your issue].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Second paragraph explaining your question. Describe where you looked for answers, what you found, and how that information is not enough for you to have a clear answer to your question. You may also include other relevant  aspects of your situation.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[OPTIONAL third paragraph where you propose answers or next steps.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Your First and Last Name]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-email&#34;&gt;Example Email&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From: examplestudent@tcstudents.tusculum.edu&lt;br&gt;
To: &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:kdmiller@tusculum.edu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;kdmiller@tusculum.edu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Cc:&lt;br&gt;
Bcc:&lt;br&gt;
Subject: SPCH 101-100: Hospitalization during late work window&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Dr. Miller&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in your 9 am Public Speaking class on Monday/Thursday. I have checked the syllabus for an answer, but it does not adequately answer my question. I need some additional help with answering questions about hospitalization during the window for late work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I checked in the syllabus, it said that I could turn in a late presentation for partial credit as long as it was within 7 days of the original due date, but the syllabus does not address what happens if an injury or illness prevents a student from turning late work in during this 7-day window. I planned to turn in the presentation I missed during this late-work window, but I was injured at a game and had to stay in the hospital overnight. This hospital stay caused me to miss getting my late work in before the end of the late-work window. I have already completed and turned in the assignment, and I have attached a note from the hospital to this email to show that I was admitted and stayed overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I cannot receive full credit for the assignment because I did not complete it prior to the  deadline but, considering these circumstances, can you accept my presentation and grade it as late work for partial credit even though I have submitted it after the 7-day window for late work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example Student&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brainstorming Topics for Presentations</title>
      <link>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/brainstorming-topics-for-presentations/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/brainstorming-topics-for-presentations/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The larger the set of topics you consider, the stronger the strongest topic will tend to be. You need to consider a large number of topics for your presentation. I generally recommend that my students consider &lt;strong&gt;around 100 topics&lt;/strong&gt; for each presentation they give in my classes. Coming up with 100 topics might seem difficult at first, but going in with a plan makes it much easier. Here are some tips to help you come up with that initial list of 100 topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write your topic ideas as a full-sentence claim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break brainstorming up into manageable chunks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask friends, family, classmates, tutors, and others for help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down every idea no matter how bad it is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use ideas you have already written down as fuel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;write-your-topic-ideas-as-a-full-sentence-claim&#34;&gt;Write your topic ideas as a full-sentence claim&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full-sentence claim is a complete sentence which says something that can be supported with evidence. Compare the difference between &amp;ldquo;King Kamehameha&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;King Kamehameha united the Hawaiian islands.&amp;rdquo; Coming up with a full-sentence claim will help you realize that there are actually several interesting topics within that broad category. It is much easier to brainstorm and compare specific topics than broad categories that only summarizes your topic area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;break-it-up-into-manageable-chunks&#34;&gt;Break it up into manageable chunks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, it is possible to come up with 100 good ideas in one sitting, but coming up with ideas starts to get pretty hard after awhile. It is a lot easier if you plan on coming up with a smaller number of ideas in several sessions. Writing down just 15 ideas at each meal for 2 days gets you almost the whole way to 100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ask-friends-family-classmates-tutors-and-others-for-help&#34;&gt;Ask friends, family, classmates, tutors, and others for help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brainstorming is easier in groups because you can be inspired by ideas that other people have. Asking for help with ideas for a topic is a great strategy. If the people that you are speaking with are similar to your target audience, it can also help you consider what topics your audience might find interesting. Plus, it gives you an excuse to call and ask your mom for her ideas, and moms love feeling like they helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;write-down-every-idea-no-matter-how-bad-it-is&#34;&gt;Write down every idea no matter how bad it is&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey! You thought of it (or someone helping you did), so give credit where credit is due! (Plus, are you really going to be the person that didn&amp;rsquo;t write down that idea your mom gave you?) &lt;strong&gt;Remember, evaluating the topics you write down comes later.&lt;/strong&gt; If your goal in brainstorming is to come up with 100 ideas to evaluate later, then in addition to 1 good idea you also need to find 99 bad ones. Brainstorming is easy if you aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid to write down a bunch of terrible ideas. You are going to throw out most of your ideas at the end of this process anyway. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry! Even if you think an idea is terrible now, that terrible idea may prove useful later when you are having trouble coming up with anything at all and you will be glad you wrote it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-ideas-you-have-already-written-down-as-fuel&#34;&gt;Use ideas you have already written down as fuel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no requirement for every idea you write down to be totally original. One way to help kick your brain into gear is to build on some of the other things that you have written down. A particularly useful mnemonic to help you figure out how to do this is SCAMPER&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:eberle-1996-scamper&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:eberle-1996-scamper&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. SCAMPER is a general purpose technique to improve brainstorming. The letters in SCAMPER stand for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substitute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adapt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put to another use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reverse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:eberle-1996-scamper&#34;&gt;Eberle, B. (1996). &lt;em&gt;Scamper: Creative games and activities for imagination development.&lt;/em&gt; Waco, TX: Prufrock Press.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:eberle-1996-scamper&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Reading &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; in my Thirties</title>
      <link>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/reading-pride-and-prejudice-in-my-thirties/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I received &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; as an audiobook from my local library, and I&amp;rsquo;m very glad. Even if I had managed to have no difficulty getting into it this time around, I only have a limited time for engaging with reading from printed books and this allowed me to go through a much longer work in a reasonable amount of time. I spend a lot of time on the road in this phase of my life, so audiobooks are a good option for me. If I had been reading the classic on paper I would have had to devote several months to reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been avoiding &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; for far too long. It was difficult to get into. The writing is very involved, and the book starts an a very slow roll. Much of the action in the book is indirectly implied. There are layers of conversational intrigue that take a lot of time to build up. It took a while to tune my senses to pay attention to the right parts of the story to track the action. I think listening to audio helped me work through to the point where all of that build up started to pay off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; is essentially a &amp;ldquo;Victorian decorum thriller.&amp;rdquo; I really enjoyed Austen&amp;rsquo;s wry sense of humor. Because I had never been successful at truly getting into the book before now, I was caught off-guard by this playfulness from Austen. It did get literally laugh-out-loud funny. I found myself chuckling several times! It was definitely unexpected given my prior experience with the novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the primary points the novel makes is the difference between being good and being friendly. This is definitely a useful lesson to remember. We often mistake friendliness and politeness with goodness. As I have aged I have become increasingly wary of charisma and what it can hide. The novel was a good reminder of that lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I really enjoyed about the &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; was the window it gave into Victorian life. It portrays a much more pragmatic perspective on life and marriage than is generally idealized today. Class and the trappings of class are incredibly important. One of the things that I noticed about the novel is how the servant class is erased almost entirely from the work. I know that there were a number of people working all around the main characters, but in Austen&amp;rsquo;s work they were less than faceless – they were invisible, they often were not even mentioned in passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a more practical note, I was surprised at Wickham&amp;rsquo;s ability to desert the Army without any real reproach. After my own years of military service, this blew me out of the water. At first I thought that this was an oversight, but after looking up some of the history of military service in this era I learned that it was fairly common for officers to enter and leave the service with some degree of fluidity. This happened in no small part because a relatively large roll of officers was needed in order to support a full command structure during a time of war. When a need emerged to conscript a large number of soldiers into service, there would be no time to identify and train up a large contingent of senior leadership in addition. To accommodate this need the rolls contained a large number of officers – many more than regular daily duties required – and so these officers often spent time both in and out of service, serving and advancing in both civilian pursuits and a military career as it suited them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, I enjoyed the book quite immensely on my first time through it successfully. It comes highly recommended, though an audio version may be the best for readers like myself, especially on a first reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-my-twenties&#34;&gt;In my Twenties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my twenties my re-reading focused on books that I had read in High School. Since I had tried to read &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; recreationally, but had never finished it or been required to read it, Austen&amp;rsquo;s classic didn&amp;rsquo;t pass through my hands in my Twenties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-my-teens&#34;&gt;In my Teens&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to read &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; in my teen years, while I was in High School, but I found it slow and uninteresting. I never really got into the book, and I soon put it down. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t required reading in any of my High School classes. I had only tried to read it because I had heard so much about it. My own experiences with it at this young age were not sufficiently exciting to draw me in for recreational reading when it wasn&amp;rsquo;t required of me, so I ended up giving up on it. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until years later when I picked it up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reserved the book from the library and when I picked it up I noticed that it had been shelved in the &amp;ldquo;Juvenile&amp;rdquo; section. I was surprised at how well-suited the book is for young readers. I had remembered it as a &amp;ldquo;very adult&amp;rdquo; sort of book, but that was not my experience as a reader at 33. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been surprised that a book considered appropriate for 6th graders at the time that I read it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be as adult as I remembered it, but I was surprised nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What London calls the &amp;ldquo;The Law of Club and Fang&amp;rdquo; reminds me of my time in the Army. Exhaustion, stress, and necessity chip away at the trappings and niceties that are built into our lives so we can ignore the fact that we are little more than bald, feeble chimps playing dress-up. In the end, &lt;em&gt;Call of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; is a love note to savagery. Buck descends from perfectly tame, through cruel hands to a life of hard work, and finally into being untamed, and is all the happier for it. Humans pass through Buck&amp;rsquo;s life as casually as he passes through theirs. Buck respects most humans, but only grows to love one. It is the loss of this last man that cuts the final tie keeping Buck in the civilized world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brutality is a consistent theme throughout the book. Men are cruel with one another, and with their animals. Paradoxically, the book presents the humane treatment of animals both as a luxury and as essential to survival. Treating the dogs roughly is presented as a requirement for life. The sled has to cross the North, and stopping could mean death. At the same time, treating them so badly they can no longer work becomes a hazard as well. Overloading the sled and under-rationing the dogs can also leave you stranded. In the end, the book distinguishes between roughness and cruelty in a way that I think is useful while also being interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was bothered at the way that the book ended. Apart from the minor foreshadowing from the arrow, there was no real treatment of natives at all. It&amp;rsquo;s unsurprising that they are entirely ignored in the novel until they become useful for the narrative, then they swarm in, deus ex machina, to bring on the denouement of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London&amp;rsquo;s novel is an example of a time period that held a strong fascination for the &amp;ldquo;noble savage.&amp;rdquo; Even now we idolize nature. I am reminded how, in the Biblical narrative, God creates the world then gives mankind dominion over the world, entrusting his creation to Adam. Modern society has ceased to view humanity as a caretaker which lives as a part of the natural world, replacing this view with the view that nature is innately good and entirely separate from humanity. This view believes that removing humanity entirely from ecosystems is the best option. They are wrong. It isn&amp;rsquo;t best (or even possible, really) to remove humanity from nature. It would be best to recognize yet again our place as a part of a natural world. Humans change ecosystems, which can be bad, but we certainly aren&amp;rsquo;t the only animal that do so and these changes are not negative by necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-my-twenties&#34;&gt;In my Twenties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my twenties my re-reading focused on books that I had read in High School only, so I did not re-read this book. In fact, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even remember reading this book at that age, or that &lt;em&gt;The Call of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;White Fang&lt;/em&gt; were even different books. I added this book to my list for The Decades Project after my first pass through the list, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t read the book in my Twenties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-my-teens&#34;&gt;In my Teens&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first read &lt;em&gt;The Call of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; in my very early teens. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the exact year, but I believe it was around the age of thirteen. Honestly, it may have even been a few years before that first year of my teens. I remember the book fondly. In fact, my memories of the book blend together with &lt;em&gt;White Fang&lt;/em&gt; a book with similar subjects by the same author which I read shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I greatly enjoyed the book. It was perfectly situated to capture the attention of a middle school kid just graduating from &lt;em&gt;Hardy Boys&lt;/em&gt; mysteries. I read the book quickly, primarily focusing on the story. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I took much from the book&amp;rsquo;s themes, but did enjoy it. As an early reader, the story was definitely the most compelling part of the novel for me, and the story was engaging for a boy around my age who had grown up with dogs in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book was probably my first significant encounter with character dialogue written in dialect. It must have been a good introduction because I didn&amp;rsquo;t remember the dialogue being written in dialect at all. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I had it as an introduction for the more difficult to decipher dialect writing used by Twain and other authors that I read later in my teens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reading &#34;Of Mice and Men&#34; in my Thirties</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I have enjoyed this novel every single time I have read it. It is a fast and easy read, and so amazingly tightly written. I keep finding new and interesting things from it at every age. The lessons that I learn seem to have similar themes, but they are always different lessens. I also love Steinbeck as a writer. This is the first time that I have read Steinbeck knowing that, as a career Academic, I am a writer too. His writing is inspirationally good – which isn&amp;rsquo;t really all that surprising once you realize he is a Nobel laureate. As someone who now has much more experience as a writer than my younger self, it is clear that he has spent a lot of time on rewriting and editing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current American climate, and my career in Academia, has really made me view &lt;em&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/em&gt; through a more feminist lens this time around. I think the paper has some very important things to say about masculinity and how masculinity is constructed. The two themes in this area that jumped out at me the most were 1) the performance of masculinity in the face of failure and 2) the fear of being powerless in the face of accusations from women. Fundamentally, both of these themes are about powerlessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also struck by the universality of yearning for an idyllic futures. We all tell ourselves these quiet lies about how some day we will arrive and then things will be much easier. &amp;ldquo;Things will be better when&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; – but they never are. As a man just arriving at the end of graduate schooling and starting in my career as an Assistant Professor, I can sympathize with looking forward to how much better life will be, even knowing that nothing can ever be as good as you can dream it will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past I hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed how cinematic Steinbeck was in his description of the scenery. The locations in which the events of the story occur almost become their own characters. They are often left alone on the &amp;ldquo;stage&amp;rdquo; at the beginning and end of chapters. Of course, this helps to personify the place and pull the reader in, but it is even more interesting in how it emphasizes the transient nature of George and Lenny&amp;rsquo;s existence. The persistence of the setting without the main characters present also draws attention to how inconsequential George and Lenny are. Their appearance and disappearance has minor impacts on the world around them, but shortly after they are gone the world soon returns to business as usual – they have not brought about any lasting changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also struck by his skillful use of foreshadowing. Everything that is in the story serves a function and establishes the facts the story continues to come back to later. In fact, the only place where I noticed an exception to this was when we traveled into Lenny&amp;rsquo;s imaginary world near the end of the novel. This sequence was so out of place that it caught me entirely off guard. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember noticing it before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-my-twenties&#34;&gt;In my Twenties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my twenties I read the novel for the second time. It was shortly after I graduated from college, within the first few years of being in the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; and before I went back to graduate school. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed the first time that Steinbeck had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. this was the first time that I read a novel aware that the author had been awarded the Nobel. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it made a difference in how I perceived the book or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story really touched me in my twenties. I found that I identified with George quite a bit. Throughout my school years, especially in Junior High, I had a number of friends who had more than the usual social and/or intellectual challenges. I understood what it was like to try to help someone understand social expectations or wrestle with unintended consequences, much as George does for Lenny throughout the novel. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember making this personal connection the first time I read the novel; perhaps I needed some distance to notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also appreciated Steinbeck&amp;rsquo;s signature style more in my twenties than in my teens. At this age I could recognize the amount of effort and drafting that goes into crafting a novel without any unnecessary words. I still thought of myself as a characteristically terse writer and I thought of Steinbeck as an ideal to be striven for, though I engaged in essentially none of the draft work that is necessary to accomplish the style well. At this age I usually edited while I wrote and thought of my writing as complete right after the first time through. I often wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even proofread, which is more than a little embarrassing looking back on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-my-teens&#34;&gt;In my Teens&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only have hazy memories of this book from my teen years. I remember reading it in High School, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t assigned reading in any of my courses. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how or why I picked it up, but it is a shockingly fast read and well worth the time if, for no other reason, the cultural fluency it bought me. There are many allusions to this book throughout popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only previous experience with Steinbeck was &lt;em&gt;The Red Pony&lt;/em&gt;, which had been required reading back in Junior High. I remember Steinbeck&amp;rsquo;s stark masculine style feeling forced and inauthentic to me in &lt;em&gt;The Red Pony&lt;/em&gt;, but in &lt;em&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/em&gt; it rang true. I was struck at the time by the way Steinbeck&amp;rsquo;s masculine style of writing fit with the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found in Steinbeck a kindred spirit. I had often been critiqued by teachers for my writing being too brief. I often struggled to make papers reach their required lengths. Reading Steinbeck felt like vindication that I could be a good writer. It was only later that I would realize how much writing, revision, and editing it takes to produce such tightly written prose.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An AutoHotKey Script to Ease Switching Among Virtual Desktops in Windows</title>
      <link>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/an-autohotkey-script-to-ease-switching-among-virtual-desktops-in-windows/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/an-autohotkey-script-to-ease-switching-among-virtual-desktops-in-windows/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: as of 2019 I have switched to Linux and no longer use this script. I have no reason to believe it has stopped working, but I make no guarantees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of &lt;a href=&#34;https://autohotkey.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AutoHotKey&lt;/a&gt;. It lets me make a lot of parts of computer interaction faster and easier for me. My most recent project was to make it faster and easier to switch between virtual desktops on my Windows 10 computer. Apple and Linux machines have employed virtual desktops for a long time, but Windows really lagged behind in this area. As a result, I was late to the party in adopting them. The easiest way to think about multiple desktops is to think about them as being literally multiple desktops that you are working on. If you have an office with a swivel chair, you know how easy it can be to swivel from the work you are doing on one desk to the reference documents you have laid out on another desk. Using virtual desktops works the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Windows hasn&amp;rsquo;t made creating or switching between multiple desktops very easy. First, you have to create all of the virtual desktops manually, which you can do by pressing the Windows key and the Tab key simultaneously. Then you need to click on the &amp;ldquo;New Desktop&amp;rdquo; link in the lower right corner of the screen. After that, you can switch between them by going to this selection screen, or with a keyboard shortcut by holding down the Windows key and the Control key while using the arrow keys to switch back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system is terrible. Using three keys at once is a pain, and the keys aren&amp;rsquo;t even on the same side of the keyboard, so I can&amp;rsquo;t switch one handed. Fortunately, I know how to fiddle with AutoHotKey to make things work better. I wrote this short script so I could hold down the blank key in the middle of my number pad (the &amp;ldquo;5&amp;rdquo; key when NumLock is on) and switch back and forth by using the left and right arrows. This key didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything anyway, so it isn&amp;rsquo;t really a loss. This was my initial script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-autohotkey&#34;&gt;; switch to previous virtual desktop with NumLock Off
NumpadClear &amp;amp; NumpadLeft::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Left}{LWin up}{LCtrl up}
; switch to next virtual desktop with NumLock off
NumpadClear &amp;amp; NumpadRight::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Right}{LWin up}{LCtrl up}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right, it&amp;rsquo;s only two lines long, but it worked great! Soon, I realized that I use it a lot and toggling NumLock was annoying. In addition, if I added a couple lines to the script, the &amp;ldquo;5&amp;rdquo; key would always function normally anyway, unless I pressed another button while it was down. I added a few lines to the script and it was even better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-autohotkey&#34;&gt;; switch to previous virtual desktop with NumLock On
Numpad5 &amp;amp; Numpad4::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Left}{LWin up}{LCtrl up}
; switch to next virtual desktop with NumLock On
Numpad5 &amp;amp; Numpad6::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Right}{LWin up}{LCtrl up}
; switch to previous virtual desktop with NumLock Off
NumpadClear &amp;amp; NumpadLeft::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Left}{LWin up}{LCtrl up}
; switch to next virtual desktop with NumLock off
NumpadClear &amp;amp; NumpadRight::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Right}{LWin up}{LCtrl up}
Numpad5::sendInput {Numpad5}
NumpadClear::sendevent {NumpadClear}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the script worked when NumLock was on and when it was off. It was perfect, except about 2 weeks later I was using my mouse and got annoyed with having to go back and forth between the keyboard and the mouse, since my number pad is also on the right side of my laptop. Then it hit me, I could switch back and forth using the left and right clicks on the mouse wheel, which I have never used for scrolling anyway. So, I added a few more lines to the script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-autohotkey&#34;&gt;; use Numpad keys to Navigate multiple virtual desktops

; switch to previous virtual desktop with NumLock On
Numpad5 &amp;amp; Numpad4::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Left}{LWin up}{LCtrl up}
; switch to next virtual desktop with NumLock On
Numpad5 &amp;amp; Numpad6::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Right}{LWin up}{LCtrl up}
; switch to previous virtual desktop with NumLock Off
NumpadClear &amp;amp; NumpadLeft::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Left}{LWin up}{LCtrl up}
; switch to next virtual desktop with NumLock off
NumpadClear &amp;amp; NumpadRight::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Right}{LWin up}{LCtrl up}
Numpad5::sendInput {Numpad5}
NumpadClear::sendevent {NumpadClear}

; use mouse wheel scroll left &amp;amp; right to navigate virtual desktops

; switch to previous virtual desktop
WheelLeft::SendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Left}{LWin up}{LCtrl up}
; switch to next virtual desktop
WheelRight::SendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Right}{LWin up}{LCtrl up}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s perfect. I can spin my virtual chair between as many virtual desktops as I like. Now I can keep my e-mail and calendar up on one desktop and check it in a moment, rather than keeping it buried in a tab in my minimized browser. Now I can write in my dissertation and quickly skip over to look through a reference or my Zotero library quickly. I love it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>End-of-Semester Lessons - 2015F</title>
      <link>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/end-of-semester-lessons-2015f/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;At the end of every semester I find that there are several things that I want to file away as important lessons for the future. I don&amp;rsquo;t know that I&amp;rsquo;ll use a categorical breakdown in the future, but I have broken down my list this semester into general lessons, lessons about teaching, and lessons about writing. They are, for lack of any better scheme, in alphabetical order. Here is my list for this semester:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;general&#34;&gt;General&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be discouraged when you fall short of your expectations – accept any degree of improvement.&lt;/strong&gt; It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you aren&amp;rsquo;t able to live up to your initial ambitious plans. As long as you are doing better, to any degree, then you are successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on setting up good systems, not just having goals.&lt;/strong&gt; Goals are fantastic and useful, but they can also become a myopic focus that causes you to miss other great opportunities. It is just as important to know when NOT to use goals as it is to know how to set good goals. Often, it is the system you set up to achieve the goal that is actually important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;teaching&#34;&gt;Teaching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have projects build on one another.&lt;/strong&gt; I have used similar strategies in the past, but this semester really underlined for me how important and beneficial this can be for students, especially in classes like presentational speaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detailed emails are a waste of time – put that information somewhere other people can see it.&lt;/strong&gt; The information that you would put into an email, while potentially accessible forever, is almost certainly destined for obscurity. If what you are saying requires a lot of detail, then you need to find a better place to put it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing&#34;&gt;Writing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I work best when I write in big chunks, AND ALSO write a little bit every day.&lt;/strong&gt; I find that writing a very small amount on my active project (dissertation) every day complements the writing that I do on dedicated writing days. It keeps the paper fresh in my mind and makes the big days much more productive. It also doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt that these small days add up over time to real progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being determined can be an obstacle to success – give up and work on something else.&lt;/strong&gt; If I am having trouble writing on one section of my dissertation, the worst thing I can do is keep bashing my head against the wall trying to force it to work. It&amp;rsquo;s OK to not be ready to work on a section yet. Just pivot, pick a different part of the problem, and drive on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define an actual writing process and framework.&lt;/strong&gt; Some writers tend to be verbose, I tend not to say enough. I became much more productive when I set a word-count goal for my dissertation. Then I had to figure out how to budget those words into chapters. Within each chapter I have had to budget it into sections. Defining a structure and targets as a framework has made me much more productive, because it lets me know that, even if I feel like I am done, I&amp;rsquo;m not done yet. In addition, I now have defined stages of the writing process that I track for each section. Now I know that my paper sections will go from &amp;ldquo;To-Do&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;First Draft&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Revised Draft&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Final Draft.&amp;rdquo; I cannot stress enough how important these features have become to my writing process. They are especially important tools for me when working on other projects in collaboration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>I Built a Duration Calculator</title>
      <link>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/i-built-a-duration-calculator/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/i-built-a-duration-calculator/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I get very frustrated when I have to add up durations of time to figure out a total amount of time. The basic communication class at &lt;a href=&#34;www.purdue.edu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Purdue&lt;/a&gt; (COM 114, a presentational speaking class) is being revamped this year. As part of that revamping, the class has gained an &amp;ldquo;Asynchronous Presentation.&amp;rdquo; I am a big supporter of this presentation, which amounts to a recorded narration over a PowerPoint-style visual aid, because it uses a lot of important skills for types of presentations that are not taught as well as they could be. I needed to add up the amount of time that students used on each slide to get a total duration for the presentation (some students didn&amp;rsquo;t set their presentations to automatically advance, so timing the entire presentation was inconsistent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had several times over the last few years where I have needed to add durations of time together, and I have never found a quick and easy way to do it. Excel is typically my go-to application for quick calculations, but it &lt;strong&gt;will not&lt;/strong&gt; handle duration. For no discernible reason, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; times in Excel are treated as &lt;em&gt;times of day&lt;/em&gt; and not durations. This comes with a number of additional problems, not the least of which is that Excel always stores all of these times of day as a decimal value representing the proportion of the day which has passed (so 12:00 noon is stored as 0.5, and 9:00 in the morning is stored as 0.375, since by 9:00 am 3/8ths of a day has already elapsed. Because of this, if I enter that a student&amp;rsquo;s introduction lasted 3 minutes and 2 seconds, Excel stores that number as 12:03:02. This has huge implications when you start adding amounts of time together, because Excel keeps trying to add &lt;em&gt;times of day&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;amounts of time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything online and I got tired of doing it by hand, so I wrote a quick application which can do it. I wrote one version that includes hours, minutes, and seconds and a second version that only includes minutes and seconds (either version can also handle decimal values in the seconds position, should you require more precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are links to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://kurtisdmiller.com/tools/hms-duration-calculator&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;HMS Duration Calculator&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://kurtisdmiller.com/tools/ms-duration-calculator&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MS Duration Calculator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Students, Stop Telling me you Won&#39;t be in Class</title>
      <link>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/students-stop-telling-me-you-wont-be-in-class/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Every semester I get emails from students that bother me. Every teacher has different preferences. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect students to have mine memorized. Even so, I still find some especially annoying. The one that has been bothering me this week is the &amp;ldquo;hey, I won&amp;rsquo;t be in class, just so you know&amp;rdquo; email. I get it, I just don&amp;rsquo;t care—unless you make it &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; problem too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-get-it&#34;&gt;I Get It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was an undergraduate student too. I remember, and I understand. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect my class to always be your top priority, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother me if it isn&amp;rsquo;t. Most traditional college students are new to adulthood, and I remember being new to adulthood myself. Being an adult almost always means juggling a variety of responsibilities and having to pick which ones are the most important at any given time. Sometimes you will have to prioritize your other classes. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter to me what your reason is. If it is important enough to you to miss class, then it is important to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, and that is what matters. It isn&amp;rsquo;t my place to judge your reasons for not being in class. I get it, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-don-t-care&#34;&gt;I Don&amp;rsquo;t Care&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong—I care about you as a person. The thing is, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect me one way or another if you are in class. I don&amp;rsquo;t plan my classes around your presence, and I don&amp;rsquo;t wait to start class until you get there. I do the same thing whether you are there or not, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter to me if you will be in class. Heck, as a faceblind person, I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even notice that you weren&amp;rsquo;t there except for in classes where I take attendance (and even then I still struggle to connect your name with who you actually are anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;except-when-you-make-it-my-problem-too&#34;&gt;Except When You Make it &lt;em&gt;My&lt;/em&gt; Problem Too&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does bother me is when you want to prioritize for free. When you trade off one priority for another, there is always a cost. I just want you to handle it like an adult. You have plenty of classmates to get information from about the class that you missed, so don&amp;rsquo;t ask me what you missed. Course policies for attendance, missed deadlines, and missing coursework were all detailed in the course documents you have had access to since the beginning of the semester. Be an adult and accept the outcomes of your actions—they should not be a surprise to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certain times when basic human compassion means you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be exempted from the costs of missing a class. Fortunately, the vast majority of these instances are already covered under university policies for things like grief, illness, military service, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Work-life Balance</title>
      <link>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/work-life-balance/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I have been seeing and hearing more from my friends, acquaintances, and even total strangers about &amp;ldquo;work-life balance.&amp;rdquo; It has really been setting me off. Sometimes I have very strong opinions about relatively minor things. At least, they seem like minor things to other people. &amp;ldquo;Work-life balance&amp;rdquo; is exactly one of these things. I am bothered because the choice of words in the phrase is fundamentally incorrect, but I&amp;rsquo;m even more bothered because of what this improper word choice reveals about our culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-words-are-wrong&#34;&gt;The Words are Wrong&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any true curmudgeon, I have a huge problem with the choice of terms here. The choice of terms in &amp;ldquo;work-life balance&amp;rdquo; carries a lot of assumptions with it that I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to tacitly endorse by using the phrase. The opposite of work is not life. I don&amp;rsquo;t stop being alive when I am at work. Even when I had a terrible job in the kitchen at a Papa John&amp;rsquo;s restaurant in High School, I was definitely still alive. The fact is that work is part of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were looking for the proper words, I would probably pick leisure, or relaxation. These are what we&amp;rsquo;re talking about anyway, right? I mean, I know a lot of parents of young children who work, and they have problems with work-life balance even when they are working less than people without children, because people caring for young children have essentially &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; leisure time. That non-work time is all filled up with keeping other humans alive and agonizing that you aren&amp;rsquo;t keeping them alive perfectly enough to keep up with their peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final word is just as bad. &amp;ldquo;Balance&amp;rdquo; carries a lot of baggage. It implies that these two extremes must be actively managed, which makes sense until you start thinking about &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; is supposed to be doing that management. In nearly every usage of the phrase that I have seen, the responsibility to balance these two goals is presented as belonging to the individual only, and not to any employer or to society. At best the employer is presented as an enabler of &amp;ldquo;work-life balance,&amp;rdquo; not as its champion. Discussions around achieving &amp;ldquo;work-life balance&amp;rdquo; typically involve things like having flexible hours or working from home. Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: you can&amp;rsquo;t achieve balance without changing the load. If many people in your industry are having problems with work-life balance, it is &lt;em&gt;not a flexibility problem,&lt;/em&gt; it is a work load problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;word-choice-matters&#34;&gt;Word Choice Matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, if this were just an issue of poor word choice, the curmudgeon in me would complain, but I would just move on. But something more is going on here. The phrase &amp;ldquo;work-life balance&amp;rdquo; places these two ideas at opposite ends of a dialectic tension, which serves to draw hard lines around work in ways that we often take for granted because they are common in modernized economies. The truth is that these hard lines are largely an exception from the perspective of human history. The homestead was the site of a majority of work for most of recorded human existence. Even when work didn&amp;rsquo;t occur in the family residence, the family often spent time at the place of work. The separation of work and the rest of our lives is both artificial and recent. It is also, I think, harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using C-SPAN Data</title>
      <link>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/using-cspan-data/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back on a weekly schedule, and loving having a bit more consistency. The students at my university are on Fall Break for Columbus Day, but I am working through it. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I took my break on Friday. This is just the price I pay for taking my day off a little bit early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;projects&#34;&gt;Projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The C-SPAN conference was amazing during the last week. I met &lt;a href=&#34;https://faculty.bentley.edu/details.asp?uname=agarcia&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Angela Garcia&lt;/a&gt; there, which was really cool. We were both presenting Conversation Analytic work that involved detailed analysis of data from the Archives. Her work using the Clinton Grand Jury testimony was really interesting. I spoke with her about putting together a panel for a future conference (possibly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.natcom.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NCA&lt;/a&gt; 2016 in Philadelphia) which would be composed of similar work. There appeared to be a lot of enthusiasm for the work I was doing, and I got some really interesting feedback as well. It isn&amp;rsquo;t my main research focus, but it is what I call my &amp;ldquo;research affair.&amp;rdquo; At least if I am blowing off what I am &amp;ldquo;supposed&amp;rdquo; to be doing, I am blowing it off to engage in a different productive line of research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though that is interesting, this is job application week, so that is my main area of focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading-focus-this-week&#34;&gt;Reading Focus this Week&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I have been reading back over an older book on how educational organizations resist change, and how to implement change in spite of this resistance (&lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0877782717&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Reigeluth &amp;amp; Garfinkle, 1994&lt;/a&gt;). I highly recommend it. Even though it is written with K-12 education as the primary subject, it has a lot of relevance to post-secondary (and even graduate &amp;amp; post-graduate) education as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Job Market is Upon Us</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;So these have started to feel more like a monthly roundup rather than a weekly one, but I&amp;rsquo;m honestly happy as long as I&amp;rsquo;m fighting the good fight. My students are settled in, fall is in the air, and the kids are thinking about Halloween now. The federal government even managed to get a budget through without shutting down, so I&amp;rsquo;m feeling pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;projects&#34;&gt;Projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am presenting my C-SPAN research at conference next week. It has been really interesting to see how everyday introduction sequence norms are modified by candidates and others while the candidate is working the crowd. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to a future line of research that looks specifically at transactional encounters with these focal persons, but I&amp;rsquo;ll have to put that off until I am back ahead on the dissertation, so perhaps it will be an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.natcom.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NCA&lt;/a&gt; submission for next year. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://associationdatabase.com/aws/CSCA/pt/sp/Home_Page&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Central States Communication Association&lt;/a&gt; deadline is Saturday, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be putting some finishing touches on a submission or two for their teaching-focused division. I also am moving forward on projects on values-centered education and student experiences on organizational exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the real crunch over the next week or two is on the job front. There are a ton of really interesting job announcements that have deadlines during the first three weeks of October, so I am doing a lot of applying. Fingers crossed for success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading-focus-this-week&#34;&gt;Reading Focus this Week&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I have been reading over a piece from the Journal of Business and Psychology (&lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:JOBU.0000028449.99127.f7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bordia, Hobman, Jones, Gollois, &amp;amp; Callan, 1993&lt;/a&gt;) which details the effects of different types of uncertainty on members of organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Settled into a New Semester - 2015F</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The month of August just flew by between preparation for and the beginning of the first semester. My students are getting ready to give their first presentation next week, and I am starting to get into the swing of a routine. I enjoyed labor day weekend, and managed to make some significant progress around settling into the new residence, so that has done a lot for my peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;projects&#34;&gt;Projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been making a lot of moves on several different research projects at once. It feels at once exciting and overwhelming. I am glad to be moving so many projects forward, but I also am aware that these projects will be a temptation that could distract me from my main focus on my dissertation project over the course of this academic year. I&amp;rsquo;m moving forward on grant-funded research that utilizes the C-SPAN archives, which is a fantastic resource. I am a huge fan of it&amp;rsquo;s persistent linking abilities that allow you to link not only to a program, but to a clipped out portion of that program. It is a fantastic opportunity for much of the Conversation Analytic (CA) focused work that I do. Not all of my work is CA focused but, for the work that is, being able to share links that point specifically to examples of each of the phenomena that I am detailing is a fantastic feature for research in that tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also continuing in my support of the Transdisciplinary Studies in Technology educational research program in Purdue&amp;rsquo;s Polytechnic program, which has involved a lot of NVIVO work over the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading-focus-this-week&#34;&gt;Reading Focus this Week&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I have been reading over a piece from Communication Monographs (&lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637759309376307&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kramer, 1993&lt;/a&gt;) which details uncertainty processes in organizations. I&amp;rsquo;ll be tracking down and locating a good article or chapter on managing uncertainty during times of organizational change for my next set of readings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adding a Friday Roundup</title>
      <link>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/adding-a-friday-roundup/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t done as much work on my dissertation over the summer up until this point as I had hoped that I would, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad. I needed some time to decompress and it has been hard to focus on work when so many more important social changes are coursing through the country. It is hard to focus on the importance of my small corner of academia when so many innocent (or at least not sufficiently guilty) people are being literally shot in the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the face of justice so poorly dispensed throughout the United States and media coverage of these tragedies which is nearly as poor, I know that I do have to refocus on advancing my own career as the new semester approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-am-i-adding-a-friday-roundup&#34;&gt;Why am I adding a Friday Roundup?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been working on the dissertation for awhile. I have been following a pretty good piece of advice that I got fairly early in the process. &amp;ldquo;If you want to be an academic, you will have to first be a writer.&amp;rdquo; This has lead me to do a lot of reading about what kinds of tips I can find for how to be a better writer. I have read many, but the one which is relevant to this post is that the best way to become good at something is to do it a lot—if you are worried that you are not a very good writer, then the best thing you can do for your writing is to do a lot more of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that vein, these posts are serving to help me keep track of what I am doing, where I have been focused over the last week, where I am currently planning on going over the next week, and so forth. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty enthusiastic about my chances of success, to be honest. I think they will help quite a bit. In order to keep them from taking my focus away from the projects that I am supposed to be focusing on, I am strictly limiting the time that I spend on them and, as a direct consequence, the amount of editing and proofreading that I do. In short, to whomever does read these roundup posts, please excuse the inevitable poor writing and grammatical/typing errors—these pieces are not intended to be polished final products, they are working documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading-focus-this-week&#34;&gt;Reading Focus this Week&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I have been reading back over an article in Communication Theory (&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2885.1992.tb00031.x&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Babrow, 1992&lt;/a&gt;) on Problematic Integration. The piece discusses the importance of communication (by which he seems to mean interpersonal communication) in the experience of integration difficulties. I am curious how perspectives on communication by other types of actors fits into the theory. This is something that I plan to look into over the next week as I try to position my piece in the larger framework of research in the fields of Communication and Education.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Classroom Audio</title>
      <link>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/classroom-audio/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The research team recorded an entire week&amp;rsquo;s worth of class meetings of three courses at four times during the course of the semester. These class meetings were recorded in video from four different angles. This resulted in a very large amount of data (approximately 200 hours of raw video) requiring about 1 Terabyte (1,000 Gigabytes) of storage space. The audio portion of the video was also rendered out and compressed into MP3 format files for ease of use and analysis when research questions can be answered without video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cleaning-classroom-audio&#34;&gt;Cleaning Classroom Audio&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting MP3 files were much easier to process and store, but audio quality, which was lacking in the original raw video, still needed to be improved. In order to make the recording process unobtrusive, the cameras and microphones were installed at the ceiling in a large classroom. As a result, classroom audio recordings included a large amount of mid-frequency noise from building electrical and mechanical systems. This noise made it difficult to discern what individuals were saying on the recording.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to improve the quality of the classroom audio, I first equalized audio to remove reduce the volume of sounds at frequencies above and below those typical of speech. Frequencies below 1,000 Hz and above 7,000 Hz were reduced by 20 dB. Frequencies between 1,000 Hz and 7,000 Hz were reduced according to a generally bell-shaped curve centered near 2,800 Hz. Once audio had been equalized to focus on speech, the next priority was to reduce hissing, humming, and other constant noises which helped to mask speech. I used a noise removal tool integrated into the &lt;a href=&#34;web.audacityteam.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt; software package (v. 2.0.6). After selecting a noise profile for each track, I reduced noise by 48 dB on each recording (with a sensitivity of -1.00 dB and attack/decay of 0.20 seconds, utilizing a frequency smoothing window of 250 Hz). Finally, I converted each recording from a stereo recording to a mono recording and combined the recording for each camera – four total – into a single file, synchronized and balanced the audio sources, and exported the audio into a cleaned MP3 format audio file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort resulted in a noticeable increase in intelligibility and reduction in recording artifacts, especially loud, high- and low-frequency pops and bangs which had limited the listening volume of the recordings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;selecting-classroom-audio&#34;&gt;Selecting Classroom Audio&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classroom audio used for this dissertation come from the first week of classes because this is the time period where the highest amount of socialization of new organizational members (the students) typically occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why this Website?</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;My adviser tells me that I am a &amp;ldquo;systems thinker.&amp;rdquo; She isn&amp;rsquo;t the first one to notice this – I know that she is right. I am constantly trying to optimize and improve the systems I use in my daily life. I notice when things aren&amp;rsquo;t working, and I &lt;strike&gt;obsess over&lt;/strike&gt; often think about ways to improve those processes. In fact, this can be quite a bit of a burden, because it means that I am constantly exposed to one of my greatest temptations to procrastination, and it quickly becomes self-reinforcing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I notice something about my workflow that isn&amp;rsquo;t working as well as it could.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I research, brainstorm and test ways to improve my workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I notice that I&amp;rsquo;m not being very productive (because I&amp;rsquo;m not working).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat from step 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way I have found to counter this process is to find ways to accomplish multiple objectives at once, preferably by building on what I am already doing. This website is a part of that process. I have been having trouble working on my dissertation for quite some time now. I know that I need to be making progress, but it just isn&amp;rsquo;t working out for me. As a communication professional, I believe that I need a strong understanding of programming, web design and web development in general. I also need to know about writing for the Internet, because the Internet has become the primary place of consuming the written word. Finally, it is important to me to maintain my own online presence. I am envisioning that this website will help me to accomplish all of these goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;working-on-the-dissertation&#34;&gt;Working on the Dissertation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my intention to post regularly about my progress on my dissertation. I don&amp;rsquo;t yet fully know what this will look like, but I do plan write posts about topics within the dissertation. This mimics the way that some classes require small, frequent assignments that can eventually yield much of the raw material in a final project. I may also post short descriptions, summaries, or reactions to pieces that I read. A lot of this is still up in the air, but what is important to me is that I derive benefit toward the dissertation and toward my eventual employment from working on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;programming-web-design-and-web-development&#34;&gt;Programming, Web Design and Web Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Communication professional, and as a knowledge worker generally, I believe it is important to understand how the Internet works. I spend a significant amount of time working with a computer, which is one of the most powerful tools that humans have ever invented. It seems like if I don&amp;rsquo;t learn how to use it effectively, I will have squandered an opportunity to be fantastic at what I do. I already do much more of these things than the average graduate student does, but I believe the payoff is worth the effort. These tools are powerful, and they are changing the world. It is, in my opinion, worth the time spent to learn how to use them well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing-for-the-internet&#34;&gt;Writing for the Internet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing for an online audience is hard. I no longer know what students are taught in High School – it has been too long since I was there – but I have not been impressed by my students&amp;rsquo; writing skills. It seems that there is an over-emphasis on one particular genre of writing, which I find troubling. The majority of students who leave high school and college are not likely to engage in very much of the type of writing that they have been taught to produce in high school and college. This is a shame. Students are not generally taught to use non-verbal elements of writing, such as layout, text styles, images, and other things which help engage readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;maintaining-an-online-presence&#34;&gt;Maintaining an Online Presence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As knowledge workers, it is becoming increasingly important for academics to have an online presence. If I want to engage people outside the &amp;ldquo;Ivory Tower&amp;rdquo; of academia, then I will need to be accessible. Maintaining an online presence allows me to engage with others and to be find-able. As I continue in the job market, I am hopeful that it may also help me to find the type of job that I want.&lt;/p&gt;
