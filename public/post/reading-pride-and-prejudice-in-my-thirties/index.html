<p>I received <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> as an audiobook from my local library, and I&rsquo;m very glad. Even if I had managed to have no difficulty getting into it this time around, I only have a limited time for engaging with reading from printed books and this allowed me to go through a much longer work in a reasonable amount of time. I spend a lot of time on the road in this phase of my life, so audiobooks are a good option for me. If I had been reading the classic on paper I would have had to devote several months to reading it.</p>

<p>I have been avoiding <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> for far too long. It was difficult to get into. The writing is very involved, and the book starts an a very slow roll. Much of the action in the book is indirectly implied. There are layers of conversational intrigue that take a lot of time to build up. It took a while to tune my senses to pay attention to the right parts of the story to track the action. I think listening to audio helped me work through to the point where all of that build up started to pay off.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> is essentially a &ldquo;Victorian decorum thriller.&rdquo; I really enjoyed Austen&rsquo;s wry sense of humor. Because I had never been successful at truly getting into the book before now, I was caught off-guard by this playfulness from Austen. It did get literally laugh-out-loud funny. I found myself chuckling several times! It was definitely unexpected given my prior experience with the novel.</p>

<p>One of the primary points the novel makes is the difference between being good and being friendly. This is definitely a useful lesson to remember. We often mistake friendliness and politeness with goodness. As I have aged I have become increasingly wary of charisma and what it can hide. The novel was a good reminder of that lesson.</p>

<p>One of the things I really enjoyed about the <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> was the window it gave into Victorian life. It portrays a much more pragmatic perspective on life and marriage than is generally idealized today. Class and the trappings of class are incredibly important. One of the things that I noticed about the novel is how the servant class is erased almost entirely from the work. I know that there were a number of people working all around the main characters, but in Austen&rsquo;s work they were less than faceless – they were invisible, they often were not even mentioned in passing.</p>

<p>On a more practical note, I was surprised at Wickham&rsquo;s ability to desert the Army without any real reproach. After my own years of military service, this blew me out of the water. At first I thought that this was an oversight, but after looking up some of the history of military service in this era I learned that it was fairly common for officers to enter and leave the service with some degree of fluidity. This happened in no small part because a relatively large roll of officers was needed in order to support a full command structure during a time of war. When a need emerged to conscript a large number of soldiers into service, there would be no time to identify and train up a large contingent of senior leadership in addition. To accommodate this need the rolls contained a large number of officers – many more than regular daily duties required – and so these officers often spent time both in and out of service, serving and advancing in both civilian pursuits and a military career as it suited them.</p>

<p>In summary, I enjoyed the book quite immensely on my first time through it successfully. It comes highly recommended, though an audio version may be the best for readers like myself, especially on a first reading.</p>

<h2 id="in-my-twenties">In my Twenties</h2>

<p>In my twenties my re-reading focused on books that I had read in High School. Since I had tried to read <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> recreationally, but had never finished it or been required to read it, Austen&rsquo;s classic didn&rsquo;t pass through my hands in my Twenties.</p>

<h2 id="in-my-teens">In my Teens</h2>

<p>I tried to read <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> in my teen years, while I was in High School, but I found it slow and uninteresting. I never really got into the book, and I soon put it down. It wasn&rsquo;t required reading in any of my High School classes. I had only tried to read it because I had heard so much about it. My own experiences with it at this young age were not sufficiently exciting to draw me in for recreational reading when it wasn&rsquo;t required of me, so I ended up giving up on it. It wasn&rsquo;t until years later when I picked it up again.</p>
