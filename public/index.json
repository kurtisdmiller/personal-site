Miller, PhD. Library 126   kurtisdmiller.com 1:00 pm – 2:50 pm, Tuesdays   kdmiller@tusculum.edu 1:00 pm – 2:50 pm, Fridays   423-636-7300 Ext. 5783 also by appointment    Course Student Learning Outcomes  Students will employ interpersonal communication theory. This outcome will be assessed in the Literature Review. Students will understand the location of interpersonal communication as a field within communication studies. This outcome will be assessed in Exam 1.  General Education Student Learning Outcomes  Writing: Students will structure evidence to convincingly support their arguments. This outcome will be assessed in the Literature Review. Public Speaking: Students will create messages appropriate to the audience, purpose, and context. This outcome will be assessed in the Fishbowl Discussion. Public Speaking: Students will evaluate personal communication strengths and weaknesses. This outcome will be practiced in Exam 1 and Exam 2. This outcome will be assessed in the Final Exam.  Required Materials The textbook for this course is \u0026ldquo;Interplay: The Process of Interpersonal Communication\u0026rdquo; (Adler, Rosenfeld, \u0026amp; Proctor). 13th or 14th edition are both acceptable.\nHow to be Successful I have taught hundreds of students. I have never seen a student do all four of these things and fail:\n Turn in all of your assignments by the deadline. Deliver every presentation by the deadline. Participate in class. Talk to me if you are having trouble.  If you want to get at least a B:\n Do everything in the first list. Take notes, including a short paragraph summary at the end of each class. Review these notes when you get home. Review the notes again right before we start the next class. Work on your assignments before the day that they are due. Read the directions on assignments and ask for help if you aren\u0026rsquo;t sure how to follow them. Work ahead. Do not wait to start an assignment until the current assignment has been turned in.  I have rarely seen a student do all seven of these things and not be satisfied with their final grade.\nAssignments and Grading Your final grade will be determined by the total points received out of 1,000 points possible. The assignments receiving points are: Participation, including attendance and classroom activities, 100 points; Fishbowl Discussion, 100 points; Literature Review, 400 points; Exam 1, 100 points; Exam 2, 100 points; Final Exam (cumulative), 200 points. Students may earn up to 60 points of Extra Credit.\nGrading Scale    Total Points Grade Quality Points1     930+ A 4.0 per semester hour    900+ A- 3.7 per semester hour    880+ B+ 3.5 per semester hour    830+ B 3.0 per semester hour    800+ B- 2.7 per semester hour    780+ C+ 2.5 per semester hour    730+ C 2.0 per semester hour    700+ C- 1.7 per semester hour    680+ D+ 1.5 per semester hour    630+ D 1.0 per semester hour    less than 630 F 0.0 per semester hour     Extra Credit Students may earn up to 60 points by participating in debate team practice sessions, 20 points for each session. Additional extra credit opportunities may also be announced as they become available. Extra Credit may not be turned in after the last class meeting.\nCourse Policies Email Policy Email is the primary and preferred method of communication for most student issues. I check and respond to my email once daily, except weekends and holidays. You should plan to check your official student email account on a similar schedule.\nThe privacy of student educational records is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). I will not respond to any communication about a student which does not come from an official school email address. I do not accept assignments by email. I do not reply to emails asking questions which are already answered in course documents.\nEngaging in professional communication with your professors and the university staff is important. Some students benefit from the below email template, which comes from a post I wrote to help students with writing professional emails. Whether you are in my class or any other class at the university, this template should work well. Just replace the information in brackets as needed:\n Subject: [class number and section]: [your issue]\nDear [Title Last Name – if you can\u0026rsquo;t find out, use \u0026ldquo;Professor\u0026rdquo; to be safe],\nI am in your [time] [class name] class on [days class meets]. I have checked the [syllabus/assignment instructions/rubric/textbook/class resources] for an answer, but it does not adequately answer my question. I need some additional help with [your issue].\n[Second paragraph explaining your question. Describe where you looked for answers, what you found, and how that information is not enough for you to have a clear answer to your question. You may also include other relevant aspects of your situation.]\n[OPTIONAL third paragraph where you propose answers or next steps.]\nThank you,\n[Your First and Last Name]\n Final Exam Policy A final exam is a required part of this course; students must take the final in order to pass the course. Final exams are administered only during three days of Final Exam Week and may not be taken early for any reason. Consult the syllabus and the Tusculum website to determine when your exams will take place and do not make travel, family, or any other plans that conflict with any of your final exams. If you see that there will be an unavoidable conflict, drop this course before the Add/Drop period concludes and sign up for a different section.\nGrade Check Policy Prepare your grade check form with information from the course management system (Moodle) prior to bringing it to me. Please remember that grade check forms are not binding. Final grade estimates for classes in progress are based on incomplete information. FERPA restrictions prevent me from looking up your grade in front of other students. This means I must rely on my memory of how students are doing in the course.\nGrade Disputes If you believe that you have been graded unfairly, wait 24 hours after receiving the grade and schedule a meeting to discuss it with me. I cannot discuss your grades publicly. Come to this meeting prepared to provide evidence supporting the need for a grade change. Grades are considered final one week after they are returned to you (or 2 days after the last class meeting).\nLate Work Policy Late work may be turned in up to 7 days after the deadline. Late work will be graded pass/fail for half credit without feedback. Late work that would normally receive a \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; or higher will receive 50% of the maximum points available. Late work that is not at least \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; quality will receive zero points. Late work is not accepted after 7 days.\nAlternate Deadlines In some rare cases an emergency may require you to miss class and turn in work after the assigned due date. These situations are handled on a case-by-case basis and, depending on the situation and documentation, this work may be assigned an alternate deadline. Coursework assigned an alternate deadline is graded for full credit, but will not receive feedback.\nAlternate deadlines will not be assigned for absences that can be planned for \u0026ndash; this includes school-sponsored events, such as athletics.\nParticipation Policy Participation will be considered as part of the course grade. Students who are not present and actively engaged in the course will not be awarded participation points, regardless of the cause for their inability to be present and actively engaged. Students are expected to be present and on time for all classroom activities and are held responsible for all learning activity missed.\nTechnology We will often use laptops/tablets/phones or other personal electronic devices for class activities. Outside of these activities, all devices should be stored out of sight with sound switched off. There is no exception for activities such as checking the time, taking notes, or accessing copies of readings for the class. Headphones should not be worn. Please contact me if you require an exception to any course policy. Please see the section on Accommodations for additional information.\nThese policies are in place because students using cell phones during class take less detailed notes, and score an average of 1.5 letter grades lower on multiple choice tests.2 Research clearly shows that increases in student cell phone use during class are associated with lower GPAs and lower test performance.3 Studies also show that students remember information better when they hand-write their notes4 and that using laptops in the classroom has negative effects on the learning of those around you.5\nTechnology Issues Issues with technology are not an excuse for late or missing work. Using technology is a basic expectation of students at this level of study. I strongly suggest that you do not wait until the last minute to complete assignments in order to allow time to resolve any technological issues that arise. If you need assistance with technology, contact Information Services.\nUniversity Policies The following policies apply to all courses at Tusculum University.\nMinimum Grade for a Course to Count Toward a Major or Minor Grades below C- earned in the student’s major and minor will satisfy the course prerequisites requirement; however, grades below C- cannot be counted in the total number of hours required in the major and minor.\nTusculum Communication Policy All students are responsible for checking their personal Tusculum University email account each day, as it is the university’s only official communication tool.\nPlagiarism and Academic Dishonesty Policy Cheating and plagiarism are violations of Ethics of Social Responsibility \u0026ndash; one of the outcomes that has been identified as essential to the Civic Arts. Plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty. It consists of knowingly presenting in writing or in speech the intellectual or creative work of others as if it were one’s own. This includes:\n Failing to identify direct or word-for-word quotations by use of appropriate symbols and reference to the source. Restating in your own words the work (ideas, conclusions, words) of another without reference to the source. Presenting as your own the creative work (for instance, music or photographs) of another without proper acknowledgment. Besides plagiarism, other forms of academic dishonesty include the following: Submitting the same work in two or more courses without significant modifications or expansion and without the approval of the instructors involved. Submitting purchased, borrowed, copied or specially commissioned work as if it were one’s own. Knowingly permitting others to submit your work under their names. Copying the work of others during an examination or other academic exercise. Knowingly allowing others to copy your work during an examination or other academic exercise. Using “cheat sheets” or any other unauthorized form of assistance during an exam, quiz or other academic exercise. Manipulating or fabricating data to support erroneous conclusions.  Academic Accommodations and Students with Disabilities Tusculum University makes available to qualified students with disabilities those reasonable accommodations or services as are necessary to provide such students with unrestricted access to the learning environment and the opportunity to demonstrate academic achievement. In order to procure services or classroom accommodations, the qualified student is responsible for self-identifying and directing all requests or accommodations or services to the Academic Resource Center counselors.

Please see the section on Accommodations for additional information.\nThese policies are in place because students using cell phones during class take less detailed notes, and score an average of 1.5 letter grades lower on multiple choice tests.2 Research clearly shows that increases in student cell phone use during class are associated with lower GPAs and lower test performance.3 Studies also show that students remember information better when they hand-write their notes4 and that using laptops in the classroom has negative effects on the learning of those around you.5\nTechnology Issues Issues with technology are not an excuse for late or missing work. Using technology is a basic expectation of students at this level of study. I strongly suggest that you do not wait until the last minute to complete assignments in order to allow time to resolve any technological issues that arise. If you need assistance with technology, contact Information Services.\nUniversity Policies The following policies apply to all courses at Tusculum University.\nMinimum Grade for a Course to Count Toward a Major or Minor Grades below C- earned in the student’s major and minor will satisfy the course prerequisites requirement; however, grades below C- cannot be counted in the total number of hours required in the major and minor.\nTusculum Communication Policy All students are responsible for checking their personal Tusculum University email account each day, as it is the university’s only official communication tool.\nPlagiarism and Academic Dishonesty Policy Cheating and plagiarism are violations of Ethics of Social Responsibility \u0026ndash; one of the outcomes that has been identified as essential to the Civic Arts. Plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty. It consists of knowingly presenting in writing or in speech the intellectual or creative work of others as if it were one’s own. This includes:\n Failing to identify direct or word-for-word quotations by use of appropriate symbols and reference to the source. Restating in your own words the work (ideas, conclusions, words) of another without reference to the source. Presenting as your own the creative work (for instance, music or photographs) of another without proper acknowledgment. Besides plagiarism, other forms of academic dishonesty include the following: Submitting the same work in two or more courses without significant modifications or expansion and without the approval of the instructors involved. Submitting purchased, borrowed, copied or specially commissioned work as if it were one’s own. Knowingly permitting others to submit your work under their names. Copying the work of others during an examination or other academic exercise. Knowingly allowing others to copy your work during an examination or other academic exercise. Using “cheat sheets” or any other unauthorized form of assistance during an exam, quiz or other academic exercise. Manipulating or fabricating data to support erroneous conclusions.

The ability to record and distribute a presentation electronically has made it far easier to reach a much greater number of people all over the world. This presentation allows you to edit and re-record portions of your presentation, and allows you to present without the pressure of a live audience, which is useful in helping new presenters overcome presentation anxiety.\nTarget Length: 7 minutes\nDue: See the calendar for your section for due dates.\nDetailed Description Objective Choose a historically significant person in your major area of study. Provide an informative presentation that informs your audience about the events which make this person historically significant to your future field. If you have more than one declared major, choose a person from one of your major areas. If you do not have a major area, choose someone who has had a historically significant impact on the field of Communication Studies.\nNote: \u0026ldquo;Historically significant\u0026rdquo; means that their actions have caused a significant change in that field. Many people who are historically significant do not end up being famous or very successful. While some people that are very successful in a field cause significant changes, many very successful people are not historically significant to any field. Likewise, while some people who are famous cause significant changes in a field, many do not. Finally, remember that a person may change a field without being in that field themselves.\nLimitations  You should not choose someone who is currently active in their career. You must use a PowerPoint-style visual aid which uses the assertion-evidence structure.  Format You will need to record the presentation and save it in a commonly-used video format in order to upload video to YouTube.

Getting off to a strong start with a good topic that you find interesting will make the research you need to do to put together a strong presentation fun, it will make it easier for you to speak passionately to your audience, and it will make it easier to put together a presentation the audience will listen to.\nBrainstorming Topics Step one is coming up with a large number of topics to evaluate. I generally recommend that students consider at least 100 topics in for each presentation they give in my classes. Coming up with that many topics can be difficult, so I put together some tips for brainstorming topics.\nEvaluating Topics Once you have an extensive list of topics, then you want to evaluate them. When evaluating topics, be sure to consider:\n The assignment Your interests Your expertise The audience  Topics that are more specific are nearly always better than general topics.\nTopics to Avoid After many years of experience teaching Public Speaking, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned that there are some topics that rarely result in high-quality student work. I strongly advise you to avoid the topics listed below.\nControversial or Political Issues Examples include (but are not limited to):\n Gun Control Gay Marriage Abortion Euthanasia Death Penalty Marijuana Evolution Social Security Any Religious Belief Paying College Athletes Title IX Lowering the Drinking Age  Actually, anything to do with drinking (even “wine is good for you”). I’m tired of hearing about drinking.   Things People Already Know They Should or Should Not Do Examples include (but are not limited to):\n Getting Enough Sleep Wearing Seat Belts Regular Exercise Hand Washing Blood Donation Organ Donation Tobacco Use Drug Use Not Driving While Distracted (ex: Texting) Voting Anything About Diet, for example:  Eating Healthy Diets Drinking more Water Eating Breakfast1 Eat This Stop Eating This  Any “Green” Topic, for example:  Recycling Conserving Water Conserving Electricity Reducing Fuel Usage The \u0026ldquo;Scary Chemical\u0026rdquo; Presentation2   Speech Topics That Are Not Creative or Unique Examples include (but are not limited to):\n The “Disease of the Week” Speech Nanotechnology Genetically Modified Foods Genetically Modified Organisms Vaccination Pet Adoption Animal Cruelty Animal Testing Fraternity/Sorority Speeches   Especially since there is no scientific evidence that clearly demonstrates a benefit to eating breakfast unless you are hungry.3 ^ Especially since everything is a chemical.4 These arguments are brilliantly satired by Tom Way in his advocacy against \u0026ldquo;Dihydrogen Monoxide\u0026rdquo; (H2O – plain water) on his website.5 ^ Carroll, A.

Citing your sources significantly improves your credibility and also protects you from committing plagiarism. When citing information in a presentation, the citation should always appear in the same channel as the information. For example, information you put on a slide should have a citation on that slide and information you say aloud should be accompanied by an oral citation. If you have information on a slide and say it out loud, then there should be a citation in both channels. The information on this page focuses on citations in presentation aids. I also have a detailed resource on Oral Citations in Presentations\nThis resource covers how to cite complete works (such as images, audio, and video) and how to cite information only.\nCiting Information in Presentation Aids There are many standardized ways to cite sources in print, and you should pick one of these to use as part of any presentation aids that can include print. The most commonly used style guides in academic writing are published by the American Psychological Association (APA)1 and the Modern Language Association (MLA)2. An addition widely used style guide is the Chicago Manual of Style3. A variation of Chicago Style designed specifically for students and scholars is also occasionally encountered, and is commonly referred to by the last name of its originator, Turabian4. The Online Writing Lab (OWL) at Purdue University maintains a set of popular online resources for [APA]APA Formatting and Style Guide, MLA, and Chicago styles.\nInformation on Slides For visual aids that rely on slides, such as PowerPoint, it is usually best to adapt citation requirements from an established style guide for print, such as those discussed above. These typically only require minimal adaptation. My standard advice is to use brief, in-text style citations on your main slides, and use full citations in a set of reference slides at the end.\nFirst, place a brief, in-text style citation next to the information being cited on the slide. If there is not enough space next to the information it may be appropriate to footnotes within each slide. Second, place full citations in their own dedicated references slide at the end of the presentation. Use multiple reference slides if needed so that references will be legible to your audience. There may be times when other approaches are more appropriate, such as providing the full citation on each slide.\nIf you are citing information only this is all you need to do, but if you are citing a complete work, such as an image, you will need to do more! Continue reading!\nInformation on Handouts For handouts, provide citations exactly as you would for a normal text document. In order to conserve paper and improve visual appeal, you may choose to place citations and references directly on the handout rather than starting them in a separate section on a new page as most style guides recommend.\nUsing Copyrighted Work in Presentation Aids For some types of work providing a citation isn\u0026rsquo;t enough. Copyrighted works belong to someone, and that person has the right to decide when and how their work gets used. Citing the source of copyrighted work is not the same as having permission to use the work. Using copyrighted work, including images, videos, and audio without permission (such as a license) is usually illegal, even with citations, unless that usage is permitted under legal exemptions to the exclusive rights of copyright holders in all applicable jurisdictions.\nIn the United States, the majority of these exemptions are listed in 17 U.S. Code Chapter 1. As a student or educator, many uses are permitted under Fair Use, described in 17 U.S. Code § 107.\nIn my classes, I require students to explicitly identify the license or source of their right to use a copyrighted work. Fair Use should only be identified as a source of this right in classes I teach when the work and all similar works are not available under any free license and it legally applies. This is important practice for future employment.\nCiting Images Taking images and using them without citation is plagiarism. Images should be cited in accordance with the requirements of the copyright holder. In my classes I require citations for images to be accompanied by a statement that identifies the source of the right to use the image. The published APA style guide does not establish standards for a full citation to use with images, but the APA Style Blog has published examples of citations for works of art.5 Based on those examples, here is a sample the full citation for an image that would go on a references slide:\n Miller, K. D. (2016, October 14). Outlining [Digital Photograph]. Retrieved from https://www.flickr.com/photos/140911330@N07/29696952664/\n Citing Audio You should provide a full oral citation either before or after an audio presentation aid. Using only a printed citation for an audio presentation aid is not appropriate because it does not match the channel of the information.\nCiting Video Video uses both audio and visual channels, and should be cited in both.\nCiting Artifacts and Objects Artifacts and objects typically do not require citations, but acknowledgments of their source are often appreciated.\n American Psychological Association (Ed.).

I also have a detailed resource on the use of Citations in Presentation Aids\nOral Citations Unlike citations in print, where standards are well established, oral citations are a bit trickier. They need to contain much of the same information as print citations.\nThe First Time a Source is Cited The first oral citation to a source has the same function as the full reference to the source that would go in a reference section at the end of a paper. An oral citation should always include as much of the following information as possible the first time that you cite it:\n Author’s name The author’s credibility (Who is this person?

Burton, an American historian and Professor of History and of Global and Transnational Studies at the University of Illinois, argues that British influence became powerful in India due to the British being successful pioneers in the industrial and technological world in her 1994 book Burdens of History: British Feminists, Indian Women, and Imperial Culture, 1865–1915.1\n Each Time the Source is Cited After Then, whenever you bring up new information in the same source, you only need to make sure we know where you got it, but you don’t need to give us all of the same information again. These subsequent citations have the same function as the brief in-text citations that go throughout a paper. You can say things like:\n \u0026ldquo;Burton\u0026rsquo;s book also argues…\u0026rdquo; “She goes on to say…” “In the same article…” “But Davis takes issue with this point…” “Samir quotes Bill Clinton as saying ‘…’” Remember: every direct quotation should include a page number (or equivalent)  Watch out for These Mistakes!  Be certain you are citing the right thing. If someone is quoted in an article then you should say that they were quoted in the article – you should not cite them directly! When you are putting citations in your outline or on your speaking notes2, you should write them as you would speak them during a presentation. Don\u0026rsquo;t leave out significant information. Always cite information in the same channel it is presented in (spoken vs. on a presentation aid) Make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t place all of your citations in your visual aid. Do not use the credibility statement in your introduction as an \u0026ldquo;oral reference section\u0026rdquo;   Burton, A. M. (1994).

While prior research shows a positive impact of such strategies on student learning, further exploration of the perceptions of traditional, lecture-based and other more inquiry-based active learning as experienced by students within the same university is needed.\nPurpose: To compare students’ perceptions of the learning environment in studio-type courses within an innovative pilot student-centered transdisciplinary learning experience to the environment in traditional lecture or lecture-and-lab courses.\nProgram description: An innovative learning experience that employs student-centered teaching strategies to engage students in the transdisciplinary exploration of technology and liberal arts within a technology-focused college in a large land-grant university.\nSample: At the end of the first semester, eight students who chose to leave the program were interviewed. At the end of the second semester, eight students who chose to remain in the program and four students who left after the first semester were interviewed.\nDesign/Method: Student were interviewed individually during the end of either their Fall 2014 semester or Spring 2015 semester. A thematic analysis was conducted. Frequency of occurrence was counted and compared for each theme.\nResults: The most frequently mentioned differences between traditional courses and this learning experience regarded instruction, assessment, and uncertainty. Students enjoyed the flexibility of a more student-centered approach, but struggled with understanding assessment and time management within self-directed transdisciplinary coursework. Student learning preferences appeared to influence their perceptions of each teaching method.\nConclusions: Although results seemed to be influenced by personal preferences, time management and dealing with uncertainty were sources of frustration across both groups of students. Scaffolding students in these two areas may help students make an easier transition toward more student-centered learning environments.","tags":["STEM education","systemic change","communication in education"],"title":"Students’ perspectives on different teaching methods: Comparing innovative and traditional courses in a technology program","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Kurtis D.

Bcc: \"Blind Carbon Copy\" – like Cc, but without letting the person you are sending the email to know that you have included other people. A good \"rule of thumb\" is NOT to use Bcc in most situations. Warning: Some email systems do not keep Bcc blind, letting the person in the \"To\" field see all recipients.

Then write the topic from their perspective. \"Class\" makes a terrible subject, because your professor teaches many classes and nearly all student emails are about one of those classes in some way.

You need to consider a large number of topics for your presentation. I generally recommend that my students consider around 100 topics for each presentation they give in my classes. Coming up with 100 topics might seem difficult at first, but going in with a plan makes it much easier. Here are some tips to help you come up with that initial list of 100 topics:\n Write your topic ideas as a full-sentence claim Break brainstorming up into manageable chunks Ask friends, family, classmates, tutors, and others for help Write down every idea no matter how bad it is Use ideas you have already written down as fuel  Write your topic ideas as a full-sentence claim A full-sentence claim is a complete sentence which says something that can be supported with evidence. Compare the difference between \u0026ldquo;King Kamehameha\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;King Kamehameha united the Hawaiian islands.\u0026rdquo; Coming up with a full-sentence claim will help you realize that there are actually several interesting topics within that broad category. It is much easier to brainstorm and compare specific topics than broad categories that only summarizes your topic area.\nBreak it up into manageable chunks Sure, it is possible to come up with 100 good ideas in one sitting, but coming up with ideas starts to get pretty hard after awhile. It is a lot easier if you plan on coming up with a smaller number of ideas in several sessions. Writing down just 15 ideas at each meal for 2 days gets you almost the whole way to 100.\nAsk friends, family, classmates, tutors, and others for help Brainstorming is easier in groups because you can be inspired by ideas that other people have. Asking for help with ideas for a topic is a great strategy. If the people that you are speaking with are similar to your target audience, it can also help you consider what topics your audience might find interesting. Plus, it gives you an excuse to call and ask your mom for her ideas, and moms love feeling like they helped.\nWrite down every idea no matter how bad it is Hey! You thought of it (or someone helping you did), so give credit where credit is due! (Plus, are you really going to be the person that didn\u0026rsquo;t write down that idea your mom gave you?) Remember, evaluating the topics you write down comes later. If your goal in brainstorming is to come up with 100 ideas to evaluate later, then in addition to 1 good idea you also need to find 99 bad ones. Brainstorming is easy if you aren\u0026rsquo;t afraid to write down a bunch of terrible ideas. You are going to throw out most of your ideas at the end of this process anyway. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry! Even if you think an idea is terrible now, that terrible idea may prove useful later when you are having trouble coming up with anything at all and you will be glad you wrote it down.\nUse ideas you have already written down as fuel There is no requirement for every idea you write down to be totally original. One way to help kick your brain into gear is to build on some of the other things that you have written down. A particularly useful mnemonic to help you figure out how to do this is SCAMPER1.

Even if I had managed to have no difficulty getting into it this time around, I only have a limited time for engaging with reading from printed books and this allowed me to go through a much longer work in a reasonable amount of time. I spend a lot of time on the road in this phase of my life, so audiobooks are a good option for me. If I had been reading the classic on paper I would have had to devote several months to reading it.\nI have been avoiding Pride and Prejudice for far too long. It was difficult to get into. The writing is very involved, and the book starts an a very slow roll. Much of the action in the book is indirectly implied. There are layers of conversational intrigue that take a lot of time to build up. It took a while to tune my senses to pay attention to the right parts of the story to track the action. I think listening to audio helped me work through to the point where all of that build up started to pay off.\nAt the end of the day, Pride and Prejudice is essentially a \u0026ldquo;Victorian decorum thriller.\u0026rdquo; I really enjoyed Austen\u0026rsquo;s wry sense of humor. Because I had never been successful at truly getting into the book before now, I was caught off-guard by this playfulness from Austen. It did get literally laugh-out-loud funny. I found myself chuckling several times! It was definitely unexpected given my prior experience with the novel.\nOne of the primary points the novel makes is the difference between being good and being friendly. This is definitely a useful lesson to remember. We often mistake friendliness and politeness with goodness. As I have aged I have become increasingly wary of charisma and what it can hide. The novel was a good reminder of that lesson.\nOne of the things I really enjoyed about the Pride and Prejudice was the window it gave into Victorian life. It portrays a much more pragmatic perspective on life and marriage than is generally idealized today. Class and the trappings of class are incredibly important. One of the things that I noticed about the novel is how the servant class is erased almost entirely from the work. I know that there were a number of people working all around the main characters, but in Austen\u0026rsquo;s work they were less than faceless – they were invisible, they often were not even mentioned in passing.\nOn a more practical note, I was surprised at Wickham\u0026rsquo;s ability to desert the Army without any real reproach. After my own years of military service, this blew me out of the water. At first I thought that this was an oversight, but after looking up some of the history of military service in this era I learned that it was fairly common for officers to enter and leave the service with some degree of fluidity. This happened in no small part because a relatively large roll of officers was needed in order to support a full command structure during a time of war. When a need emerged to conscript a large number of soldiers into service, there would be no time to identify and train up a large contingent of senior leadership in addition. To accommodate this need the rolls contained a large number of officers – many more than regular daily duties required – and so these officers often spent time both in and out of service, serving and advancing in both civilian pursuits and a military career as it suited them.\nIn summary, I enjoyed the book quite immensely on my first time through it successfully. It comes highly recommended, though an audio version may be the best for readers like myself, especially on a first reading.\nIn my Twenties In my twenties my re-reading focused on books that I had read in High School. Since I had tried to read Pride and Prejudice recreationally, but had never finished it or been required to read it, Austen\u0026rsquo;s classic didn\u0026rsquo;t pass through my hands in my Twenties.\nIn my Teens I tried to read Pride and Prejudice in my teen years, while I was in High School, but I found it slow and uninteresting. I never really got into the book, and I soon put it down. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t required reading in any of my High School classes. I had only tried to read it because I had heard so much about it. My own experiences with it at this young age were not sufficiently exciting to draw me in for recreational reading when it wasn\u0026rsquo;t required of me, so I ended up giving up on it. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until years later when I picked it up again.\n","date":1487116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1487116800,"objectID":"de6fe588ea7594d5dfb1f97db3aa6dc8","permalink":"https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/reading-pride-and-prejudice-in-my-thirties/","publishdate":"2017-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/reading-pride-and-prejudice-in-my-thirties/","section":"post","summary":"I received Pride and Prejudice as an audiobook from my local library, and I\u0026rsquo;m very glad.

I was surprised at how well-suited the book is for young readers. I had remembered it as a \u0026ldquo;very adult\u0026rdquo; sort of book, but that was not my experience as a reader at 33. I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been surprised that a book considered appropriate for 6th graders at the time that I read it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be as adult as I remembered it, but I was surprised nonetheless.\nWhat London calls the \u0026ldquo;The Law of Club and Fang\u0026rdquo; reminds me of my time in the Army. Exhaustion, stress, and necessity chip away at the trappings and niceties that are built into our lives so we can ignore the fact that we are little more than bald, feeble chimps playing dress-up. In the end, Call of the Wild is a love note to savagery. Buck descends from perfectly tame, through cruel hands to a life of hard work, and finally into being untamed, and is all the happier for it. Humans pass through Buck\u0026rsquo;s life as casually as he passes through theirs. Buck respects most humans, but only grows to love one. It is the loss of this last man that cuts the final tie keeping Buck in the civilized world.\nBrutality is a consistent theme throughout the book. Men are cruel with one another, and with their animals. Paradoxically, the book presents the humane treatment of animals both as a luxury and as essential to survival. Treating the dogs roughly is presented as a requirement for life. The sled has to cross the North, and stopping could mean death. At the same time, treating them so badly they can no longer work becomes a hazard as well. Overloading the sled and under-rationing the dogs can also leave you stranded. In the end, the book distinguishes between roughness and cruelty in a way that I think is useful while also being interesting.\nI was bothered at the way that the book ended. Apart from the minor foreshadowing from the arrow, there was no real treatment of natives at all. It\u0026rsquo;s unsurprising that they are entirely ignored in the novel until they become useful for the narrative, then they swarm in, deus ex machina, to bring on the denouement of the story.\nLondon\u0026rsquo;s novel is an example of a time period that held a strong fascination for the \u0026ldquo;noble savage.\u0026rdquo; Even now we idolize nature. I am reminded how, in the Biblical narrative, God creates the world then gives mankind dominion over the world, entrusting his creation to Adam. Modern society has ceased to view humanity as a caretaker which lives as a part of the natural world, replacing this view with the view that nature is innately good and entirely separate from humanity. This view believes that removing humanity entirely from ecosystems is the best option. They are wrong. It isn\u0026rsquo;t best (or even possible, really) to remove humanity from nature. It would be best to recognize yet again our place as a part of a natural world. Humans change ecosystems, which can be bad, but we certainly aren\u0026rsquo;t the only animal that do so and these changes are not negative by necessity.\nIn my Twenties In my twenties my re-reading focused on books that I had read in High School only, so I did not re-read this book. In fact, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even remember reading this book at that age, or that The Call of the Wild and White Fang were even different books. I added this book to my list for The Decades Project after my first pass through the list, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t read the book in my Twenties.\nIn my Teens I first read The Call of the Wild in my very early teens. I can\u0026rsquo;t remember the exact year, but I believe it was around the age of thirteen. Honestly, it may have even been a few years before that first year of my teens. I remember the book fondly. In fact, my memories of the book blend together with White Fang a book with similar subjects by the same author which I read shortly after.\nI greatly enjoyed the book. It was perfectly situated to capture the attention of a middle school kid just graduating from Hardy Boys mysteries. I read the book quickly, primarily focusing on the story. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I took much from the book\u0026rsquo;s themes, but did enjoy it. As an early reader, the story was definitely the most compelling part of the novel for me, and the story was engaging for a boy around my age who had grown up with dogs in the country.\nThis book was probably my first significant encounter with character dialogue written in dialect. It must have been a good introduction because I didn\u0026rsquo;t remember the dialogue being written in dialect at all. I\u0026rsquo;m glad I had it as an introduction for the more difficult to decipher dialect writing used by Twain and other authors that I read later in my teens.\n","date":1483401600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483401600,"objectID":"eaab79e6656ec06fb4fc60bef034540b","permalink":"https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/reading-the-call-of-the-wild-in-my-thirties/","publishdate":"2017-01-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/reading-the-call-of-the-wild-in-my-thirties/","section":"post","summary":"I reserved the book from the library and when I picked it up I noticed that it had been shelved in the \u0026ldquo;Juvenile\u0026rdquo; section.

It is a fast and easy read, and so amazingly tightly written. I keep finding new and interesting things from it at every age. The lessons that I learn seem to have similar themes, but they are always different lessens. I also love Steinbeck as a writer. This is the first time that I have read Steinbeck knowing that, as a career Academic, I am a writer too. His writing is inspirationally good – which isn\u0026rsquo;t really all that surprising once you realize he is a Nobel laureate. As someone who now has much more experience as a writer than my younger self, it is clear that he has spent a lot of time on rewriting and editing.\nThe current American climate, and my career in Academia, has really made me view Of Mice and Men through a more feminist lens this time around. I think the paper has some very important things to say about masculinity and how masculinity is constructed. The two themes in this area that jumped out at me the most were 1) the performance of masculinity in the face of failure and 2) the fear of being powerless in the face of accusations from women. Fundamentally, both of these themes are about powerlessness.\nI was also struck by the universality of yearning for an idyllic futures. We all tell ourselves these quiet lies about how some day we will arrive and then things will be much easier. \u0026ldquo;Things will be better when\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; – but they never are. As a man just arriving at the end of graduate schooling and starting in my career as an Assistant Professor, I can sympathize with looking forward to how much better life will be, even knowing that nothing can ever be as good as you can dream it will be.\nIn the past I hadn\u0026rsquo;t noticed how cinematic Steinbeck was in his description of the scenery. The locations in which the events of the story occur almost become their own characters. They are often left alone on the \u0026ldquo;stage\u0026rdquo; at the beginning and end of chapters. Of course, this helps to personify the place and pull the reader in, but it is even more interesting in how it emphasizes the transient nature of George and Lenny\u0026rsquo;s existence. The persistence of the setting without the main characters present also draws attention to how inconsequential George and Lenny are. Their appearance and disappearance has minor impacts on the world around them, but shortly after they are gone the world soon returns to business as usual – they have not brought about any lasting changes.\nI was also struck by his skillful use of foreshadowing. Everything that is in the story serves a function and establishes the facts the story continues to come back to later. In fact, the only place where I noticed an exception to this was when we traveled into Lenny\u0026rsquo;s imaginary world near the end of the novel. This sequence was so out of place that it caught me entirely off guard. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember noticing it before.\nIn my Twenties In my twenties I read the novel for the second time. It was shortly after I graduated from college, within the first few years of being in the \u0026ldquo;real world\u0026rdquo; and before I went back to graduate school. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t noticed the first time that Steinbeck had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. this was the first time that I read a novel aware that the author had been awarded the Nobel. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it made a difference in how I perceived the book or not.\nThe story really touched me in my twenties. I found that I identified with George quite a bit. Throughout my school years, especially in Junior High, I had a number of friends who had more than the usual social and/or intellectual challenges. I understood what it was like to try to help someone understand social expectations or wrestle with unintended consequences, much as George does for Lenny throughout the novel. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember making this personal connection the first time I read the novel; perhaps I needed some distance to notice.\nI also appreciated Steinbeck\u0026rsquo;s signature style more in my twenties than in my teens. At this age I could recognize the amount of effort and drafting that goes into crafting a novel without any unnecessary words. I still thought of myself as a characteristically terse writer and I thought of Steinbeck as an ideal to be striven for, though I engaged in essentially none of the draft work that is necessary to accomplish the style well. At this age I usually edited while I wrote and thought of my writing as complete right after the first time through. I often wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even proofread, which is more than a little embarrassing looking back on it.\nIn my Teens I only have hazy memories of this book from my teen years. I remember reading it in High School, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t assigned reading in any of my courses. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how or why I picked it up, but it is a shockingly fast read and well worth the time if, for no other reason, the cultural fluency it bought me. There are many allusions to this book throughout popular culture.\nMy only previous experience with Steinbeck was The Red Pony, which had been required reading back in Junior High. I remember Steinbeck\u0026rsquo;s stark masculine style feeling forced and inauthentic to me in The Red Pony, but in Of Mice and Men it rang true. I was struck at the time by the way Steinbeck\u0026rsquo;s masculine style of writing fit with the subject matter.\nI found in Steinbeck a kindred spirit. I had often been critiqued by teachers for my writing being too brief. I often struggled to make papers reach their required lengths. Reading Steinbeck felt like vindication that I could be a good writer. It was only later that I would realize how much writing, revision, and editing it takes to produce such tightly written prose.\n","date":1476835200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1476835200,"objectID":"6c5ef3667c6d42cc9011dd1d443cfad7","permalink":"https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/reading-of-mice-and-men-in-my-thirties/","publishdate":"2016-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/reading-of-mice-and-men-in-my-thirties/","section":"post","summary":"I have enjoyed this novel every single time I have read it.

I have no reason to believe it has stopped working, but I make no guarantees.\nI am a big fan of AutoHotKey. It lets me make a lot of parts of computer interaction faster and easier for me. My most recent project was to make it faster and easier to switch between virtual desktops on my Windows 10 computer. Apple and Linux machines have employed virtual desktops for a long time, but Windows really lagged behind in this area. As a result, I was late to the party in adopting them. The easiest way to think about multiple desktops is to think about them as being literally multiple desktops that you are working on. If you have an office with a swivel chair, you know how easy it can be to swivel from the work you are doing on one desk to the reference documents you have laid out on another desk. Using virtual desktops works the same way.\nUnfortunately, Windows hasn\u0026rsquo;t made creating or switching between multiple desktops very easy. First, you have to create all of the virtual desktops manually, which you can do by pressing the Windows key and the Tab key simultaneously. Then you need to click on the \u0026ldquo;New Desktop\u0026rdquo; link in the lower right corner of the screen. After that, you can switch between them by going to this selection screen, or with a keyboard shortcut by holding down the Windows key and the Control key while using the arrow keys to switch back and forth.\nThis system is terrible. Using three keys at once is a pain, and the keys aren\u0026rsquo;t even on the same side of the keyboard, so I can\u0026rsquo;t switch one handed. Fortunately, I know how to fiddle with AutoHotKey to make things work better. I wrote this short script so I could hold down the blank key in the middle of my number pad (the \u0026ldquo;5\u0026rdquo; key when NumLock is on) and switch back and forth by using the left and right arrows. This key didn\u0026rsquo;t do anything anyway, so it isn\u0026rsquo;t really a loss. This was my initial script:\n; switch to previous virtual desktop with NumLock Off NumpadClear \u0026amp; NumpadLeft::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Left}{LWin up}{LCtrl up} ; switch to next virtual desktop with NumLock off NumpadClear \u0026amp; NumpadRight::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Right}{LWin up}{LCtrl up}  That\u0026rsquo;s right, it\u0026rsquo;s only two lines long, but it worked great! Soon, I realized that I use it a lot and toggling NumLock was annoying. In addition, if I added a couple lines to the script, the \u0026ldquo;5\u0026rdquo; key would always function normally anyway, unless I pressed another button while it was down. I added a few lines to the script and it was even better:\n; switch to previous virtual desktop with NumLock On Numpad5 \u0026amp; Numpad4::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Left}{LWin up}{LCtrl up} ; switch to next virtual desktop with NumLock On Numpad5 \u0026amp; Numpad6::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Right}{LWin up}{LCtrl up} ; switch to previous virtual desktop with NumLock Off NumpadClear \u0026amp; NumpadLeft::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Left}{LWin up}{LCtrl up} ; switch to next virtual desktop with NumLock off NumpadClear \u0026amp; NumpadRight::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Right}{LWin up}{LCtrl up} Numpad5::sendInput {Numpad5} NumpadClear::sendevent {NumpadClear}  Now the script worked when NumLock was on and when it was off. It was perfect, except about 2 weeks later I was using my mouse and got annoyed with having to go back and forth between the keyboard and the mouse, since my number pad is also on the right side of my laptop. Then it hit me, I could switch back and forth using the left and right clicks on the mouse wheel, which I have never used for scrolling anyway. So, I added a few more lines to the script.\n; use Numpad keys to Navigate multiple virtual desktops ; switch to previous virtual desktop with NumLock On Numpad5 \u0026amp; Numpad4::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Left}{LWin up}{LCtrl up} ; switch to next virtual desktop with NumLock On Numpad5 \u0026amp; Numpad6::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Right}{LWin up}{LCtrl up} ; switch to previous virtual desktop with NumLock Off NumpadClear \u0026amp; NumpadLeft::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Left}{LWin up}{LCtrl up} ; switch to next virtual desktop with NumLock off NumpadClear \u0026amp; NumpadRight::sendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Right}{LWin up}{LCtrl up} Numpad5::sendInput {Numpad5} NumpadClear::sendevent {NumpadClear} ; use mouse wheel scroll left \u0026amp; right to navigate virtual desktops ; switch to previous virtual desktop WheelLeft::SendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Left}{LWin up}{LCtrl up} ; switch to next virtual desktop WheelRight::SendInput {LWin down}{LCtrl down}{Right}{LWin up}{LCtrl up}  Now it\u0026rsquo;s perfect. I can spin my virtual chair between as many virtual desktops as I like. Now I can keep my e-mail and calendar up on one desktop and check it in a moment, rather than keeping it buried in a tab in my minimized browser. Now I can write in my dissertation and quickly skip over to look through a reference or my Zotero library quickly. I love it.\n","date":1453852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1453852800,"objectID":"09253b15a4f2f4d442ec09fcc14dc25b","permalink":"https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/an-autohotkey-script-to-ease-switching-among-virtual-desktops-in-windows/","publishdate":"2016-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/an-autohotkey-script-to-ease-switching-among-virtual-desktops-in-windows/","section":"post","summary":"Update: as of 2019 I have switched to Linux and no longer use this script.

I don\u0026rsquo;t know that I\u0026rsquo;ll use a categorical breakdown in the future, but I have broken down my list this semester into general lessons, lessons about teaching, and lessons about writing. They are, for lack of any better scheme, in alphabetical order. Here is my list for this semester:\nGeneral  Don\u0026rsquo;t be discouraged when you fall short of your expectations – accept any degree of improvement. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if you aren\u0026rsquo;t able to live up to your initial ambitious plans. As long as you are doing better, to any degree, then you are successful. Focus on setting up good systems, not just having goals. Goals are fantastic and useful, but they can also become a myopic focus that causes you to miss other great opportunities. It is just as important to know when NOT to use goals as it is to know how to set good goals. Often, it is the system you set up to achieve the goal that is actually important.  Teaching  Have projects build on one another. I have used similar strategies in the past, but this semester really underlined for me how important and beneficial this can be for students, especially in classes like presentational speaking. Detailed emails are a waste of time – put that information somewhere other people can see it. The information that you would put into an email, while potentially accessible forever, is almost certainly destined for obscurity. If what you are saying requires a lot of detail, then you need to find a better place to put it.  Writing  I work best when I write in big chunks, AND ALSO write a little bit every day. I find that writing a very small amount on my active project (dissertation) every day complements the writing that I do on dedicated writing days. It keeps the paper fresh in my mind and makes the big days much more productive. It also doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt that these small days add up over time to real progress. Being determined can be an obstacle to success – give up and work on something else. If I am having trouble writing on one section of my dissertation, the worst thing I can do is keep bashing my head against the wall trying to force it to work. It\u0026rsquo;s OK to not be ready to work on a section yet. Just pivot, pick a different part of the problem, and drive on. Define an actual writing process and framework. Some writers tend to be verbose, I tend not to say enough. I became much more productive when I set a word-count goal for my dissertation. Then I had to figure out how to budget those words into chapters. Within each chapter I have had to budget it into sections. Defining a structure and targets as a framework has made me much more productive, because it lets me know that, even if I feel like I am done, I\u0026rsquo;m not done yet. In addition, I now have defined stages of the writing process that I track for each section. Now I know that my paper sections will go from \u0026ldquo;To-Do\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;First Draft\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Revised Draft\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Final Draft.\u0026rdquo; I cannot stress enough how important these features have become to my writing process.

Excel is typically my go-to application for quick calculations, but it will not handle duration. For no discernible reason, all times in Excel are treated as times of day and not durations. This comes with a number of additional problems, not the least of which is that Excel always stores all of these times of day as a decimal value representing the proportion of the day which has passed (so 12:00 noon is stored as 0.5, and 9:00 in the morning is stored as 0.375, since by 9:00 am 3/8ths of a day has already elapsed. Because of this, if I enter that a student\u0026rsquo;s introduction lasted 3 minutes and 2 seconds, Excel stores that number as 12:03:02. This has huge implications when you start adding amounts of time together, because Excel keeps trying to add times of day and not amounts of time.\nLong story short, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find anything online and I got tired of doing it by hand, so I wrote a quick application which can do it. I wrote one version that includes hours, minutes, and seconds and a second version that only includes minutes and seconds (either version can also handle decimal values in the seconds position, should you require more precision.\nHere are links to the HMS Duration Calculator and the MS Duration Calculator.\n","date":1449187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1449187200,"objectID":"ea8e2589523fa86921bfa77d488a69ad","permalink":"https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/i-built-a-duration-calculator/","publishdate":"2015-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/i-built-a-duration-calculator/","section":"post","summary":"I get very frustrated when I have to add up durations of time to figure out a total amount of time.

I get it, I just don\u0026rsquo;t care—unless you make it my problem too.\nI Get It I was an undergraduate student too. I remember, and I understand. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect my class to always be your top priority, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t bother me if it isn\u0026rsquo;t. Most traditional college students are new to adulthood, and I remember being new to adulthood myself. Being an adult almost always means juggling a variety of responsibilities and having to pick which ones are the most important at any given time. Sometimes you will have to prioritize your other classes. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter to me what your reason is. If it is important enough to you to miss class, then it is important to you, and that is what matters. It isn\u0026rsquo;t my place to judge your reasons for not being in class. I get it, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t bother me.\nI Don\u0026rsquo;t Care Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong—I care about you as a person. The thing is, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect me one way or another if you are in class. I don\u0026rsquo;t plan my classes around your presence, and I don\u0026rsquo;t wait to start class until you get there. I do the same thing whether you are there or not, so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter to me if you will be in class. Heck, as a faceblind person, I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even notice that you weren\u0026rsquo;t there except for in classes where I take attendance (and even then I still struggle to connect your name with who you actually are anyway).\nExcept When You Make it My Problem Too What does bother me is when you want to prioritize for free. When you trade off one priority for another, there is always a cost. I just want you to handle it like an adult. You have plenty of classmates to get information from about the class that you missed, so don\u0026rsquo;t ask me what you missed. Course policies for attendance, missed deadlines, and missing coursework were all detailed in the course documents you have had access to since the beginning of the semester. Be an adult and accept the outcomes of your actions—they should not be a surprise to you.\nThere are certain times when basic human compassion means you should be exempted from the costs of missing a class. Fortunately, the vast majority of these instances are already covered under university policies for things like grief, illness, military service, etc.\n","date":1445558400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1445558400,"objectID":"9d2367c075091fdf57391f3c5494a8a2","permalink":"https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/students-stop-telling-me-you-wont-be-in-class/","publishdate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/students-stop-telling-me-you-wont-be-in-class/","section":"post","summary":"Every semester I get emails from students that bother me.

Sometimes I have very strong opinions about relatively minor things. At least, they seem like minor things to other people. \u0026ldquo;Work-life balance\u0026rdquo; is exactly one of these things. I am bothered because the choice of words in the phrase is fundamentally incorrect, but I\u0026rsquo;m even more bothered because of what this improper word choice reveals about our culture.\nThe Words are Wrong Like any true curmudgeon, I have a huge problem with the choice of terms here. The choice of terms in \u0026ldquo;work-life balance\u0026rdquo; carries a lot of assumptions with it that I\u0026rsquo;m not willing to tacitly endorse by using the phrase. The opposite of work is not life. I don\u0026rsquo;t stop being alive when I am at work. Even when I had a terrible job in the kitchen at a Papa John\u0026rsquo;s restaurant in High School, I was definitely still alive. The fact is that work is part of my life.\nIf I were looking for the proper words, I would probably pick leisure, or relaxation. These are what we\u0026rsquo;re talking about anyway, right? I mean, I know a lot of parents of young children who work, and they have problems with work-life balance even when they are working less than people without children, because people caring for young children have essentially no leisure time. That non-work time is all filled up with keeping other humans alive and agonizing that you aren\u0026rsquo;t keeping them alive perfectly enough to keep up with their peers.\nThe final word is just as bad. \u0026ldquo;Balance\u0026rdquo; carries a lot of baggage. It implies that these two extremes must be actively managed, which makes sense until you start thinking about who is supposed to be doing that management. In nearly every usage of the phrase that I have seen, the responsibility to balance these two goals is presented as belonging to the individual only, and not to any employer or to society. At best the employer is presented as an enabler of \u0026ldquo;work-life balance,\u0026rdquo; not as its champion. Discussions around achieving \u0026ldquo;work-life balance\u0026rdquo; typically involve things like having flexible hours or working from home. Here\u0026rsquo;s the thing: you can\u0026rsquo;t achieve balance without changing the load. If many people in your industry are having problems with work-life balance, it is not a flexibility problem, it is a work load problem.\nWord Choice Matters The thing is, if this were just an issue of poor word choice, the curmudgeon in me would complain, but I would just move on. But something more is going on here. The phrase \u0026ldquo;work-life balance\u0026rdquo; places these two ideas at opposite ends of a dialectic tension, which serves to draw hard lines around work in ways that we often take for granted because they are common in modernized economies. The truth is that these hard lines are largely an exception from the perspective of human history. The homestead was the site of a majority of work for most of recorded human existence. Even when work didn\u0026rsquo;t occur in the family residence, the family often spent time at the place of work. The separation of work and the rest of our lives is both artificial and recent. It is also, I think, harmful.\n","date":1444953600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1444953600,"objectID":"7dad5f1dbfcbb45a989ad990419718c5","permalink":"https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/work-life-balance/","publishdate":"2015-10-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/work-life-balance/","section":"post","summary":"I have been seeing and hearing more from my friends, acquaintances, and even total strangers about \u0026ldquo;work-life balance.\u0026rdquo; It has really been setting me off.

These class meetings were recorded in video from four different angles. This resulted in a very large amount of data (approximately 200 hours of raw video) requiring about 1 Terabyte (1,000 Gigabytes) of storage space. The audio portion of the video was also rendered out and compressed into MP3 format files for ease of use and analysis when research questions can be answered without video.\nCleaning Classroom Audio The resulting MP3 files were much easier to process and store, but audio quality, which was lacking in the original raw video, still needed to be improved. In order to make the recording process unobtrusive, the cameras and microphones were installed at the ceiling in a large classroom. As a result, classroom audio recordings included a large amount of mid-frequency noise from building electrical and mechanical systems. This noise made it difficult to discern what individuals were saying on the recording.\nIn order to improve the quality of the classroom audio, I first equalized audio to remove reduce the volume of sounds at frequencies above and below those typical of speech. Frequencies below 1,000 Hz and above 7,000 Hz were reduced by 20 dB. Frequencies between 1,000 Hz and 7,000 Hz were reduced according to a generally bell-shaped curve centered near 2,800 Hz. Once audio had been equalized to focus on speech, the next priority was to reduce hissing, humming, and other constant noises which helped to mask speech. I used a noise removal tool integrated into the Audacity software package (v. 2.0.6). After selecting a noise profile for each track, I reduced noise by 48 dB on each recording (with a sensitivity of -1.00 dB and attack/decay of 0.20 seconds, utilizing a frequency smoothing window of 250 Hz). Finally, I converted each recording from a stereo recording to a mono recording and combined the recording for each camera – four total – into a single file, synchronized and balanced the audio sources, and exported the audio into a cleaned MP3 format audio file.\nThis effort resulted in a noticeable increase in intelligibility and reduction in recording artifacts, especially loud, high- and low-frequency pops and bangs which had limited the listening volume of the recordings.\nSelecting Classroom Audio The classroom audio used for this dissertation come from the first week of classes because this is the time period where the highest amount of socialization of new organizational members (the students) typically occurs.\n","date":1433721600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1433721600,"objectID":"f367522201cd546e0537f5f3d6026ec3","permalink":"https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/classroom-audio/","publishdate":"2015-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/classroom-audio/","section":"post","summary":"The research team recorded an entire week\u0026rsquo;s worth of class meetings of three courses at four times during the course of the semester.

In fact, this can be quite a bit of a burden, because it means that I am constantly exposed to one of my greatest temptations to procrastination, and it quickly becomes self-reinforcing:\n I notice something about my workflow that isn\u0026rsquo;t working as well as it could.

I don\u0026rsquo;t yet fully know what this will look like, but I do plan write posts about topics within the dissertation. This mimics the way that some classes require small, frequent assignments that can eventually yield much of the raw material in a final project. I may also post short descriptions, summaries, or reactions to pieces that I read. A lot of this is still up in the air, but what is important to me is that I derive benefit toward the dissertation and toward my eventual employment from working on the website.\nProgramming, Web Design and Web Development As a Communication professional, and as a knowledge worker generally, I believe it is important to understand how the Internet works.

I already do much more of these things than the average graduate student does, but I believe the payoff is worth the effort. These tools are powerful, and they are changing the world. It is, in my opinion, worth the time spent to learn how to use them well.\nWriting for the Internet Writing for an online audience is hard. I no longer know what students are taught in High School – it has been too long since I was there – but I have not been impressed by my students\u0026rsquo; writing skills. It seems that there is an over-emphasis on one particular genre of writing, which I find troubling. The majority of students who leave high school and college are not likely to engage in very much of the type of writing that they have been taught to produce in high school and college. This is a shame. Students are not generally taught to use non-verbal elements of writing, such as layout, text styles, images, and other things which help engage readers.\nMaintaining an Online Presence As knowledge workers, it is becoming increasingly important for academics to have an online presence. If I want to engage people outside the \u0026ldquo;Ivory Tower\u0026rdquo; of academia, then I will need to be accessible. Maintaining an online presence allows me to engage with others and to be find-able. As I continue in the job market, I am hopeful that it may also help me to find the type of job that I want.\n","date":1433376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1433376000,"objectID":"e9d1bbf51aa841c9381fc0a9c1156e23","permalink":"https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/why-this-website/","publishdate":"2015-06-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/why-this-website/","section":"post","summary":"My adviser tells me that I am a \u0026ldquo;systems thinker.\u0026rdquo; She isn\u0026rsquo;t the first one to notice this – I know that she is right.

Understand the difference between formal and informal fallacies. Name several common fallacies. Recognize these fallacies and booby-traps in the real world.  Rationale: Students are constantly exposed to persuasive messages in the real world. Many of these messages promote logically flawed reasoning or contain logically flawed arguments. Creating and evaluating persuasive messages is a keystone skill in our field. Persuasive speeches are fundamental components of the basic course in communication, and most communication departments offer semester-long classes on persuasion. Persuasive messages which employ or promote fallacious reasoning may be less effective, and can be considered unethical.\nMaterials Needed Materials:\n None.  Technology:\n A classroom projector and computer for any video examples  Outline of the Lesson  Review of previous session\u0026rsquo;s content Lesson opening Open classroom discussion about logical fallacies Types of logical fallacies  Propositional fallacies  Affirming the Consequent Denying the Antecedent Affirming a Disjunct Commutation of Conditionals  Probabilistic fallacies  The Base Rate fallacy The Gambler\u0026rsquo;s fallacy The Hot Hand fallacy Multiple Comparisons fallacy  Bad Reasons fallacies  \u0026ldquo;The conclusion must be wrong because the argument was bad.\u0026rdquo; The Fallacist\u0026rsquo;s fallacy  Red Herring fallacies  Straw Person Genetic fallacy (Ad Hominem) Bandwagon fallacy \u0026ldquo;Two wrongs make a right\u0026rdquo; (Tu Quoque) Appeal to Consequences Appeal to Emotion Guilt by Association  Vagueness fallacies  Slippery Slope False Precision  Non causa pro causa  Cum hoc, ergo propter hoc Post hoc, ergo propter hoc Regression fallacy Texas Sharpshooter fallacy  Weak analogies  Unrepresentative sample Hasty Generalization  Question Begging  Loaded Words Naturalistic fallacy  False Dilemma  Activity1\n Day 1  Introduce key concepts.\nStudents will need to understand the following key concepts: premise, argument, fallacy, validity, testimony, formal fallacy, and informal fallacy. The instructor demonstrates how fallacies and logical booby-traps work.\nThe naturalistic fallacy works well. Many products are advertised as “natural” or “all natural.” Students readily understand once it is pointed out that things which are not natural can be good (examples: a classroom education, riding a bicycle, sunscreen), and some things which are natural are dangerous anyway (examples: arsenic, tobacco, poison ivy, mountain lions). Caution: Avoid using products where naturalness is logically relevant, such as food products, as this is not fallacious reasoning. Cleaning products are good choices. Assign students a fallacy.\nStudents pick a fallacy from a larger typology of common fallacies2 or are assigned one. If students pick their own fallacies, the instructor should ensure that common fallacies are not excluded. Common fallacies include the hasty generalization, false dilemma, weak analogy, slippery slope, the naturalistic fallacy, and post/cum hoc ergo propter hoc fallacies. The red herring family of fallacies (ad hominem, bandwagon, straw person, appeal to misleading authority, etc.) is also common.  Between Classes:  Students identify examples outside of class.\nStudents may use print advertisements or video examples. Videos should be less than one minute long (most advertisements meet this easily). Students should not use examples that require long blocks of text. The example can be an example of a logical fallacy (an argument), or an example of a logical booby-trap.  Day 2:  Students show the examples they found.\nStudents show the examples that they found in class and explain why the argument is fallacious. If your room has a projector and document camera, you can use this to display print examples for full class analysis. This is a good time to talk about the distinctions between formal and informal fallacies, which helps students distinguish between an argument’s form and its content. It is also a good time to talk about the difference between fallacies, which contain an explicit argument, and logical booby-traps, which do not.   Lesson closing\n  Limitations The activity requires two different classroom days to devote to this assignment. The activity requires a classroom projector and computer for video examples. The activity can be completed without these, if students do not bring video examples.\nDebrief The majority of students will find decent examples of fallacies. Some will come back with good examples of fallacies, just not examples of the fallacies they were assigned. This is ok, and is a good opportunity to talk about how some fallacies are related conceptually. You may not have time to show all of the examples during class, particularly if they are videos that students can only find again by clicking on a link they e-mailed to themselves.\nVariations and Accommodations  Assign for credit or extra credit through the semester. Cap the number of examples you will accept for each fallacy. This works well in a persuasion class. Include a short paper where the student analyzes and corrects the flawed argument. Have students identify the fallacies in teams.  Follow guidance from local accommodation authorities.\nLesson Plan Version Currently v0.01\nA previous version of the activity from this lesson plan was competitively selected for presentation at a conference.1\nEnd Notes  Miller, K.
