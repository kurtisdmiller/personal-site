&lt;p&gt;Attending regional conferences is one of the most exciting parts of my job. I always leave with so much inspiration from the work of the many amazing scholars across the country. This year, the Southern States Communication Association conference was held in Nashville from April 5th through April 8th, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t even have to leave the state!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things about the SSCA conferences is its relaxed atmosphere and the opportunity to engage with so many welcoming people. Below is a summary of my professional activities at the conference, as well as links to all files used in the presentations I gave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tennessee-promise-panel&#34;&gt;Tennessee Promise Panel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;100%&#34; src=&#34;https://kurtisdmiller.com/img/conference/IMG_20180405_134501.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photograph of the members of the panel&#34; title=&#34;Brad Bailey, Jennifer James, Karen Johnson, Katelyn Brooks, Leonard Assante, and Scott Christen&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presented as part of a panel of scholars discussing the impact of Tennessee Promise, a program designed to create &amp;ldquo;free community college&amp;rdquo; for students in Tennessee. We had the opportunity to discuss both the intended and unintended consequences of the program at a variety of institutions, including community colleges, 4-year public institutions, and 4-year private institutions. We were especially lucky to be placed in two back-to-back slots in the program for this discussion, which was lively and interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was honored to participate as the only representative of a private institution and the only representative of a small liberal-arts college. A special shout-out to Leonard Assante, Katelyn Brooks, Scott Christen, Jennifer James, Karen Johnson, Malcolm McAvoy, and Patrick Richey for their contributions to the panel, and to Brad Bailey for Chairing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gifts&#34;&gt;GIFTS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a fantastic time presenting on a GIFTS panel! I presented a Great Idea For Teaching Students (GIFTS) titled &lt;em&gt;Slides Against Humanity&lt;/em&gt; in Session I. A special shout out to Doug Pruim for being the co-author on this presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so proud that I had the opportunity to work together with so many wonderful scholars to put together a panel on providing effective feedback at the 2018 Southern States Communication Association Conference. I organized a panel titled &lt;em&gt;Musings on Instructor Feedback: Improving the Process and Quality of Feedback&lt;/em&gt; which came out of a series of conversations at the 2017 Tennessee Communication Association conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My contribution to the panel was titled &lt;em&gt;Hashtag Feedback: Using Text Expansion to Streamline the Process of Providing Detailed Effective Feedback&lt;/em&gt;. A special shout out to Jacob Metz, L&amp;rsquo;Oreal Stephens, and Karen Johnson for their contributions to the panel, and to Brad Bailey for stepping in at the last minute to Chair in addition to preparing his own contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing Professional Emails</title>
      <link>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/writing-professional-emails/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Engaging in professional communication with your professor is a good habit and it helps ensure that they have a good impression of you. Many students have difficulty using email effectively. If you are having trouble figuring out how to put together an email to your professor, you can&amp;rsquo;t go wrong with the template below. Whether you are in my class or any other class at the college, this template should work well. I have also included an example email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;addressing-and-header-information&#34;&gt;Addressing and Header Information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;From:&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;Your official school email address.&lt;/dd&gt; 
  &lt;dt&gt;To:&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;Your professor&#39;s email address, as listed in the syllabus.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Cc:&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&#34;Carbon Copy&#34; - list anyone else you want to see your email, such as an advisor or coach. A good &#34;rule of thumb&#34; is to Cc anyone you mention in the email.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Bcc:&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&#34;Blind Carbon Copy&#34; – like Cc, but without letting the person you are sending the email to know that you have included other people. A good &#34;rule of thumb&#34; is NOT to use Bcc in most situations. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Some email systems do not keep Bcc blind, letting the person in the &#34;To&#34; field see all recipients.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Subject:&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;Start with your class and section. Then write the topic from &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; perspective. &#34;Class&#34; makes a terrible subject, because your professor teaches many classes and nearly all student emails are about one of those classes in some way.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;email-template&#34;&gt;Email Template&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace the information in brackets below as appropriate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject: [class number and section]: [your issue]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear [Title, use &amp;ldquo;Professor&amp;rdquo; to be safe if you do not know] [Last Name],&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in your [time] [class name] class on [days class meets]. I have checked the [syllabus/assignment instructions/rubric/textbook/class resources] for an answer, but it does not adequately answer my question. I need some additional help with [your issue].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Second paragraph explaining your question. Describe where you looked for answers, what you found, and how that information is not enough for you to have a clear answer to your question. You may also include other relevant  aspects of your situation.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[OPTIONAL third paragraph where you propose answers or next steps.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Your First and Last Name]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-email&#34;&gt;Example Email&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From: examplestudent@tcstudents.tusculum.edu&lt;br&gt;
To: &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:kdmiller@tusculum.edu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;kdmiller@tusculum.edu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Cc:&lt;br&gt;
Bcc:&lt;br&gt;
Subject: SPCH 101-100: Hospitalization during late work window&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Dr. Miller&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in your 9 am Public Speaking class on Monday/Thursday. I have checked the syllabus for an answer, but it does not adequately answer my question. I need some additional help with answering questions about hospitalization during the window for late work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I checked in the syllabus, it said that I could turn in a late presentation for partial credit as long as it was within 7 days of the original due date, but the syllabus does not address what happens if an injury or illness prevents a student from turning late work in during this 7-day window. I planned to turn in the presentation I missed during this late-work window, but I was injured at a game and had to stay in the hospital overnight. This hospital stay caused me to miss getting my late work in before the end of the late-work window. I have already completed and turned in the assignment, and I have attached a note from the hospital to this email to show that I was admitted and stayed overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I cannot receive full credit for the assignment because I did not complete it prior to the  deadline but, considering these circumstances, can you accept my presentation and grade it as late work for partial credit even though I have submitted it after the 7-day window for late work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example Student&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brainstorming Topics for Presentations</title>
      <link>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/brainstorming-topics-for-presentations/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/brainstorming-topics-for-presentations/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The larger the set of topics you consider, the stronger the strongest topic will tend to be. You need to consider a large number of topics for your presentation. I generally recommend that my students consider &lt;strong&gt;around 100 topics&lt;/strong&gt; for each presentation they give in my classes. Coming up with 100 topics might seem difficult at first, but going in with a plan makes it much easier. Here are some tips to help you come up with that initial list of 100 topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write your topic ideas as a full-sentence claim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break brainstorming up into manageable chunks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask friends, family, classmates, tutors, and others for help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down every idea no matter how bad it is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use ideas you have already written down as fuel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;write-your-topic-ideas-as-a-full-sentence-claim&#34;&gt;Write your topic ideas as a full-sentence claim&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full-sentence claim is a complete sentence which says something that can be supported with evidence. Compare the difference between &amp;ldquo;King Kamehameha&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;King Kamehameha united the Hawaiian islands.&amp;rdquo; Coming up with a full-sentence claim will help you realize that there are actually several interesting topics within that broad category. It is much easier to brainstorm and compare specific topics than broad categories that only summarizes your topic area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;break-it-up-into-manageable-chunks&#34;&gt;Break it up into manageable chunks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, it is possible to come up with 100 good ideas in one sitting, but coming up with ideas starts to get pretty hard after awhile. It is a lot easier if you plan on coming up with a smaller number of ideas in several sessions. Writing down just 15 ideas at each meal for 2 days gets you almost the whole way to 100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ask-friends-family-classmates-tutors-and-others-for-help&#34;&gt;Ask friends, family, classmates, tutors, and others for help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brainstorming is easier in groups because you can be inspired by ideas that other people have. Asking for help with ideas for a topic is a great strategy. If the people that you are speaking with are similar to your target audience, it can also help you consider what topics your audience might find interesting. Plus, it gives you an excuse to call and ask your mom for her ideas, and moms love feeling like they helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;write-down-every-idea-no-matter-how-bad-it-is&#34;&gt;Write down every idea no matter how bad it is&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey! You thought of it (or someone helping you did), so give credit where credit is due! (Plus, are you really going to be the person that didn&amp;rsquo;t write down that idea your mom gave you?) &lt;strong&gt;Remember, evaluating the topics you write down comes later.&lt;/strong&gt; If your goal in brainstorming is to come up with 100 ideas to evaluate later, then in addition to 1 good idea you also need to find 99 bad ones. Brainstorming is easy if you aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid to write down a bunch of terrible ideas. You are going to throw out most of your ideas at the end of this process anyway. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry! Even if you think an idea is terrible now, that terrible idea may prove useful later when you are having trouble coming up with anything at all and you will be glad you wrote it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-ideas-you-have-already-written-down-as-fuel&#34;&gt;Use ideas you have already written down as fuel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no requirement for every idea you write down to be totally original. One way to help kick your brain into gear is to build on some of the other things that you have written down. A particularly useful mnemonic to help you figure out how to do this is SCAMPER&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:eberle-1996-scamper&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:eberle-1996-scamper&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. SCAMPER is a general purpose technique to improve brainstorming. The letters in SCAMPER stand for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substitute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adapt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put to another use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reverse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:eberle-1996-scamper&#34;&gt;Eberle, B. (1996). &lt;em&gt;Scamper: Creative games and activities for imagination development.&lt;/em&gt; Waco, TX: Prufrock Press.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:eberle-1996-scamper&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>End-of-Semester Lessons - 2015F</title>
      <link>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/end-of-semester-lessons-2015f/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/end-of-semester-lessons-2015f/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;At the end of every semester I find that there are several things that I want to file away as important lessons for the future. I don&amp;rsquo;t know that I&amp;rsquo;ll use a categorical breakdown in the future, but I have broken down my list this semester into general lessons, lessons about teaching, and lessons about writing. They are, for lack of any better scheme, in alphabetical order. Here is my list for this semester:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;general&#34;&gt;General&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be discouraged when you fall short of your expectations – accept any degree of improvement.&lt;/strong&gt; It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you aren&amp;rsquo;t able to live up to your initial ambitious plans. As long as you are doing better, to any degree, then you are successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on setting up good systems, not just having goals.&lt;/strong&gt; Goals are fantastic and useful, but they can also become a myopic focus that causes you to miss other great opportunities. It is just as important to know when NOT to use goals as it is to know how to set good goals. Often, it is the system you set up to achieve the goal that is actually important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;teaching&#34;&gt;Teaching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have projects build on one another.&lt;/strong&gt; I have used similar strategies in the past, but this semester really underlined for me how important and beneficial this can be for students, especially in classes like presentational speaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detailed emails are a waste of time – put that information somewhere other people can see it.&lt;/strong&gt; The information that you would put into an email, while potentially accessible forever, is almost certainly destined for obscurity. If what you are saying requires a lot of detail, then you need to find a better place to put it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing&#34;&gt;Writing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I work best when I write in big chunks, AND ALSO write a little bit every day.&lt;/strong&gt; I find that writing a very small amount on my active project (dissertation) every day complements the writing that I do on dedicated writing days. It keeps the paper fresh in my mind and makes the big days much more productive. It also doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt that these small days add up over time to real progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being determined can be an obstacle to success – give up and work on something else.&lt;/strong&gt; If I am having trouble writing on one section of my dissertation, the worst thing I can do is keep bashing my head against the wall trying to force it to work. It&amp;rsquo;s OK to not be ready to work on a section yet. Just pivot, pick a different part of the problem, and drive on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define an actual writing process and framework.&lt;/strong&gt; Some writers tend to be verbose, I tend not to say enough. I became much more productive when I set a word-count goal for my dissertation. Then I had to figure out how to budget those words into chapters. Within each chapter I have had to budget it into sections. Defining a structure and targets as a framework has made me much more productive, because it lets me know that, even if I feel like I am done, I&amp;rsquo;m not done yet. In addition, I now have defined stages of the writing process that I track for each section. Now I know that my paper sections will go from &amp;ldquo;To-Do&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;First Draft&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Revised Draft&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Final Draft.&amp;rdquo; I cannot stress enough how important these features have become to my writing process. They are especially important tools for me when working on other projects in collaboration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>I Built a Duration Calculator</title>
      <link>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/i-built-a-duration-calculator/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kurtisdmiller.com/post/i-built-a-duration-calculator/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I get very frustrated when I have to add up durations of time to figure out a total amount of time. The basic communication class at &lt;a href=&#34;www.purdue.edu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Purdue&lt;/a&gt; (COM 114, a presentational speaking class) is being revamped this year. As part of that revamping, the class has gained an &amp;ldquo;Asynchronous Presentation.&amp;rdquo; I am a big supporter of this presentation, which amounts to a recorded narration over a PowerPoint-style visual aid, because it uses a lot of important skills for types of presentations that are not taught as well as they could be. I needed to add up the amount of time that students used on each slide to get a total duration for the presentation (some students didn&amp;rsquo;t set their presentations to automatically advance, so timing the entire presentation was inconsistent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had several times over the last few years where I have needed to add durations of time together, and I have never found a quick and easy way to do it. Excel is typically my go-to application for quick calculations, but it &lt;strong&gt;will not&lt;/strong&gt; handle duration. For no discernible reason, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; times in Excel are treated as &lt;em&gt;times of day&lt;/em&gt; and not durations. This comes with a number of additional problems, not the least of which is that Excel always stores all of these times of day as a decimal value representing the proportion of the day which has passed (so 12:00 noon is stored as 0.5, and 9:00 in the morning is stored as 0.375, since by 9:00 am 3/8ths of a day has already elapsed. Because of this, if I enter that a student&amp;rsquo;s introduction lasted 3 minutes and 2 seconds, Excel stores that number as 12:03:02. This has huge implications when you start adding amounts of time together, because Excel keeps trying to add &lt;em&gt;times of day&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;amounts of time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything online and I got tired of doing it by hand, so I wrote a quick application which can do it. I wrote one version that includes hours, minutes, and seconds and a second version that only includes minutes and seconds (either version can also handle decimal values in the seconds position, should you require more precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are links to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://kurtisdmiller.com/tools/hms-duration-calculator&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;HMS Duration Calculator&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://kurtisdmiller.com/tools/ms-duration-calculator&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MS Duration Calculator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every semester I get emails from students that bother me. Every teacher has different preferences. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect students to have mine memorized. Even so, I still find some especially annoying. The one that has been bothering me this week is the &amp;ldquo;hey, I won&amp;rsquo;t be in class, just so you know&amp;rdquo; email. I get it, I just don&amp;rsquo;t care—unless you make it &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; problem too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-get-it&#34;&gt;I Get It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was an undergraduate student too. I remember, and I understand. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect my class to always be your top priority, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother me if it isn&amp;rsquo;t. Most traditional college students are new to adulthood, and I remember being new to adulthood myself. Being an adult almost always means juggling a variety of responsibilities and having to pick which ones are the most important at any given time. Sometimes you will have to prioritize your other classes. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter to me what your reason is. If it is important enough to you to miss class, then it is important to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, and that is what matters. It isn&amp;rsquo;t my place to judge your reasons for not being in class. I get it, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-don-t-care&#34;&gt;I Don&amp;rsquo;t Care&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong—I care about you as a person. The thing is, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect me one way or another if you are in class. I don&amp;rsquo;t plan my classes around your presence, and I don&amp;rsquo;t wait to start class until you get there. I do the same thing whether you are there or not, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter to me if you will be in class. Heck, as a faceblind person, I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even notice that you weren&amp;rsquo;t there except for in classes where I take attendance (and even then I still struggle to connect your name with who you actually are anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;except-when-you-make-it-my-problem-too&#34;&gt;Except When You Make it &lt;em&gt;My&lt;/em&gt; Problem Too&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does bother me is when you want to prioritize for free. When you trade off one priority for another, there is always a cost. I just want you to handle it like an adult. You have plenty of classmates to get information from about the class that you missed, so don&amp;rsquo;t ask me what you missed. Course policies for attendance, missed deadlines, and missing coursework were all detailed in the course documents you have had access to since the beginning of the semester. Be an adult and accept the outcomes of your actions—they should not be a surprise to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certain times when basic human compassion means you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be exempted from the costs of missing a class. Fortunately, the vast majority of these instances are already covered under university policies for things like grief, illness, military service, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
