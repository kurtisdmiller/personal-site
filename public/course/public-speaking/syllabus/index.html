nonverbal messaging, and techniques of oral presentation and persuasion.
Students will learn to research, outline, and deliver a variety of
speeches (e.g. demonstrative, informative, persuasive, special occasion,

<h2 id="course-student-learning-outcomes">Course Student Learning Outcomes</h2>

<ol>
<li>Students will employ presentation aids which clearly and accurately
enhance their presentations. This outcome will be practiced by
preparing visual aids for presentations throughout the course. The
outcome will be assessed through performance on the <a href="/course/public-speaking/assignment/support-assignment" title="Assignment description">Support
Presentation</a>.</li>
<li>Students will complete a mediated presentation. The outcome will be
assessed through performance on the <a href="/course/public-speaking/assignment/mediated-assignment" title="Assignment description">Mediated Presentation</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="general-education-student-learning-outcomes">General Education Student Learning Outcomes</h2>

<ol>
<li>Writing: Students will structure evidence to convincingly support their
arguments. This outcome will be practiced by preparing outlines for
presentations throughout the course. This outcome will be assessed
through performance on the <a href="/course/public-speaking/assignment/persuasive-assignment" title="Assignment description">Persuasive Presentation</a>.</li>
<li>Public Speaking: Students will create messages appropriate to the
audience, purpose, and context. This outcome will be practiced in
presentations throughout the course. The outcome will be assessed
through performance in the <a href="/course/public-speaking/assignment/debate-assignment" title="Assignment description">Debate</a>.</li>
<li>Public Speaking: Students will evaluate personal communication
strengths and weaknesses. This outcome will be practiced on the
Mid-term Exam. This outcome will be assessed on the Final Exam.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="required-materials">Required Materials</h2>

<p>The textbook for this course is &ldquo;A Speaker&rsquo;s Guidebook&rdquo; (O&rsquo;Hair, Stewart,
&amp; Rubenstein). 5th or 6th edition are both acceptable. The textbook is
very affordable and there is also a copy on reserve in the library. In
addition to the textbook and standard classroom supplies, you will need
a flash drive, white 3x5 index cards, access to a video recording device
(such as a phone), and a YouTube account.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-be-successful">How to be Successful</h2>

<p>I have taught hundreds of students. I have never seen a student do all
four of these things and fail:</p>

<ol>
<li>Turn in all of your assignments by the deadline.</li>
<li>Deliver every presentation by the deadline.</li>
<li>Participate in class.</li>
<li>Talk to me if you are having trouble.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to get at least a B:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do everything in the first list.</li>
<li>Take notes, including a short paragraph summary at the end of each class.</li>
<li>Review these notes when you get home.</li>
<li>Review the notes again right before we start the next class.</li>
<li>Work on your assignments before the day that they are due.</li>
<li>Read the directions on assignments and ask for help if you aren&rsquo;t sure how to follow them.</li>
<li>Work ahead. Do not wait to start an assignment until the current assignment has been turned in.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have <em>rarely</em> seen a student do all seven of these things and not be
satisfied with their final grade.</p>

<h1 id="assignments-and-grading">Assignments and Grading</h1>

<p>Your final grade will be determined by the total points received out of
1,000 points possible. The assignments receiving points are:

<h2 id="extra-credit">Extra Credit</h2>

<p>Students may earn up to 60 points by participating in debate team practice
sessions, 20 points for each session. Additional extra credit
opportunities may also be announced as they become available. Extra Credit
may not be turned in after the last class meeting.</p>

<h1 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h1>

<h2 id="appropriate-topic-policy">Appropriate Topic Policy</h2>

<p>Presentation topics should be appropriate for a classroom of college-aged
professionals. See the <a href="/courses/public-speaking/assignment/presentation-topics/">presentation topics</a> resource for assastance
with picking a strong topic. Students should not present on duplicate
topics. Students can claim topics using the course management system. The
first student to post a topic will be allowed to present on it. Any other
presentation on that topic will be graded for half credit.</p>

<h2 id="email-policy">Email Policy</h2>

<p>Email is the primary and preferred method of communication for most
student issues. I check and respond to my email once daily, except
weekends and holidays. You should plan to check your official student
email account on a similar schedule.</p>

<p>The privacy of student educational records is protected by the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). I will not respond to any
communication about a student which does not come from an official school
email address. I do not accept assignments by email. I do not reply to
emails asking questions which are already answered in course documents.</p>

<p>Engaging in professional communication with your professors and the
university staff is important. Some students benefit from the below email
template, which comes from a post I wrote to help students with <a href="/post/writing-professional-emails/">writing
professional emails</a>. Whether you are in my class or any other class at
the university, this template should work well. Just replace the
information in brackets as needed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Subject: [class number and section]: [your issue]</p>

<p>Dear [Title Last Name  – if you can&rsquo;t find out, use &ldquo;Professor&rdquo; to be
safe],</p>

<p>I am in your [time] [class name] class on [days class meets]. I have
checked the [syllabus/assignment instructions/rubric/textbook/class
resources] for an answer, but it does not adequately answer my question.
I need some additional help with [your issue].</p>

<p>[Second paragraph explaining your question. Describe where you looked
for answers, what you found, and how that information is not enough for
you to have a clear answer to your question. You may also include other
relevant  aspects of your situation.]</p>

<p>[OPTIONAL third paragraph where you propose answers or next steps.]</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>[Your First and Last Name]</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="final-exam-policy">Final Exam Policy</h2>

<p>A final exam is a required part of this course; students must take the
final in order to pass the course. Final exams are idministered only
during three days of Final Exam Week and may not be taken early for any
reason. Consult the syllabus and the Tusculum website to determine when
your exams will take place and do not make travel, family, or any other
plans that conflict with any of your final exams. If you see that there
will be an unavoidable conflict, drop this course before the Add/Drop
period concludes and sign up for a different section.</p>

<h2 id="grade-check-policy">Grade Check Policy</h2>

<p>Prepare your grade check form with information from the course management
system (Moodle) prior to bringing it to me. Please remember that grade
check forms are not binding. Final grade estimates for classes in progress
are based on incomplete information. FERPA restrictions prevent me from
looking up your grade in front of other students. This means I must rely
on my memory of how students are doing in the course.</p>

<h2 id="grade-disputes">Grade Disputes</h2>

<p>If you believe that you have been graded unfairly, wait 24 hours after
receiving the grade and schedule a meeting to discuss it with me. I cannot
discuss your grades publically. Come to this meeting prepared to provide
evidence supporting the need for a grade change. Grades are considered
final one week after they are returned to you (or 2 days after the last
class meeting).</p>

<h2 id="late-work-policy">Late Work Policy</h2>

<p>Late work may be turned in up to 7 days after the deadline. Late work will
be graded <strong><em>pass/fail for half credit without feedback.</em></strong> Late work that
would normally receive a &ldquo;C&rdquo; or higher will receive 50% of the maximum
points available. Late work that is not at least &ldquo;C&rdquo; quality will receive
zero points. Late work is not accepted after 7 days. Class time will not
be provided for late presentations. Presentations may be turned in late by
following the instructions for <a href="/course/public-speaking/assignment/submitting-presentations-by-video" title="Assignment description">video submission</a>. Follow the <a href="/course/public-speaking/assignment/submitting-presentations-by-video" title="Assignment description">video
submission</a> link for more information.</p>

<h3 id="alternate-deadlines">Alternate Deadlines</h3>

<p>In some rare cases an emergency may require you to miss class and turn in
work after the assigned due date. These situations are handled on
a case-by-case basis and, depending on the situation and documentation,
this work may be assigned an alternate deadline. Coursework assigned an
alternate deadline is graded for full credit, but will not receive
feedback.</p>

<p>Alternate deadlines will not be assigned for absences that can be planned
for &ndash; this includes school-sponsored events, such as athletics.
Presentations may always be turned in early using <a href="/course/public-speaking/assignment/submitting-presentations-by-video" title="Assignment description">video submission</a>.
Follow the <a href="/course/public-speaking/assignment/submitting-presentations-by-video" title="Assignment description">video submission</a> link for more information.</p>

<h2 id="participation-policy">Participation Policy</h2>

<p>Particpation will be considered as part of the course grade. Students who
are not present and actively engaged in the course will not be awarded
participation points, regardless of the cause for their inibility to be
present and actively engaged. Students are expected to be present and on
time for all classroom activities and are held responsible for all
learning activity missed.</p>

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>

<p>We will often use laptops/tablets/phones or other personal electronic
devices for class activities. Outside of these activities, all devices
should be stored out of sight with sound switched off. There is no
exception for activities such as checking the time, taking notes, or
accessing copies of readings for the class. Headphones should not be worn.
Please contact me if you require an exception to any course policy. Please
see the section on
<a href="#academic-accommodations-and-students-with-disibilities">Accommodations</a>
for additional information.</p>

<p>These policies are in place because students using cell phones during
class take less detailed notes, and score an average of 1.5 letter grades
lower on multiple choice tests.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:kuznekoff-titsworth-2013"><a href="#fn:kuznekoff-titsworth-2013">2</a></sup> Research
clearly shows that increases in student cell phone use during class are
associated with lower GPAs and lower test
performance.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:Bjornsen-Archer-2015-StudentCellPhone"><a href="#fn:Bjornsen-Archer-2015-StudentCellPhone">3</a></sup> Studies also show
that students remember information better when they hand-write their
notes<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:Mueller-Oppenheimer-2014-PenMightier"><a href="#fn:Mueller-Oppenheimer-2014-PenMightier">4</a></sup> and that using laptops in the
classroom has negative effects on the learning of those around
you.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:Sana-etal-2013-LaptopMultitasking"><a href="#fn:Sana-etal-2013-LaptopMultitasking">5</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="technology-issues">Technology Issues</h3>

<p>Issues with technology are not an excuse for late or missing work. Using
technology is a basic expectation of students at this level of study.
I strongly suggest that you do not wait until the last minute to complete
assignments in order to allow time to resolve any technological issues
that arise. If you need assistance with technology, contact <a href="http://www3.tusculum.edu/is/" target="_blank">Information
Services</a>.</p>
