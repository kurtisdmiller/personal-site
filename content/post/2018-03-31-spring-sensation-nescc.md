The Andrew Johnson Debate Team at Tusculum had another strong showing over the Easter weekend. Alex Rolison (Senior, Museum Studies) and River Donnelly (Sophomore, Psychology) finished in 5th place at the 12th annual Spring Sensation tournament at Northeast State Community College in Blountville, TN. There were 13 pairings representing 6 schools at this competition. Alex and River had only one loss during the round-robin portion of the tournament, but finished just outside the top four pairings, who went on to the elimination phase of the tournament. This is a very impressive finish considering that this tournament is only the second competition since the club was founded this Spring.
