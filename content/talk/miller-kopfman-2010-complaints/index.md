title: "The effects of outward communicator traits on complaint perception"
event: "96th Annual Meeting of the National Communication Association"
event_url:
location: "San Francisco, CA"
summary: "Participants rated complaints delivered by individuals with differing gender and racial/ethnic traits in terms of severity/seriousness, interest, and fairness. Gender of complainer had no effect on any perceptions, but race/ethnicity of complainer produced significant effects in all three areas. Unexpectedly, complaints were rated more severe/serious, interesting, and fair when delivered by minorities compared to white individuals. Post hoc findings revealed that female respondents rated complaints higher in severity, interest, and fairness than males."
