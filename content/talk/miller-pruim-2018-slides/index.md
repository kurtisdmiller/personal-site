title: "Slides against humanity"
event: "88th Annual Meeting of the Southern States Communication Association"
event_url:
location: "Nashville, TN"
summary: 
abstract: "Research shows that slides which use the assertion-evidence structure (a full-sentence
assertion heading directly supported by visual evidence) are much more effective than typical
slides. In this activity students create a series of assertion-evidence slides to support a claim.
Students are paired using two “Cards Against Humanity” style decks of cards to create a
ridiculous claim. Student teams then create a slide show which includes three assertion-evidence
structured content slides to support their claim. Students gain practice constructing assertion
headings which support their claim, selecting various kinds of visual evidence to support these
assertion headings, and visually citing that evidence."
