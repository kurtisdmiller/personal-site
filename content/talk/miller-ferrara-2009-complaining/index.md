title: "The speech act of complaining: Preliminary quantitative research"
event: "95th Annual Meeting of the National Communication Association"
event_url:
location: "Chicago, IL"
summary: "There has been little research into complaining as an interpersonal speech act. What research has been conducted has focused on consumer or patient complaint behavior, the boss-employee or spousal relationships. Participants kept a complaint journal over 4 days, recording complaints heard and made by the participant and metadata concerning the complaint. Findings indicated many areas for further study, including statistically significant relationships between: relative age, gender, fixability, severity, solicitation, interest, self-perception, power, and relationship type."
