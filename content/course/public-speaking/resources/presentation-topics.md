Picking a topic is one of the hardest parts of putting together a presentation, and it is one of the most important.
Getting off to a strong start with a good topic that you find interesting will make the research you need to do to put together a strong presentation fun, it will make it easier for you to speak passionately to your audience, and it will make it easier to put together a presentation the audience will listen to.

Brainstorming Topics
====================

Step one is coming up with a large number of topics to evaluate.
I generally recommend that students consider **at least 100 topics** for each presentation they give in my classes.
Coming up with that many topics can be difficult, so I put together some [tips for brainstorming topics][].

Evaluating Topics
=================

Once you have an extensive list of topics, then you want to evaluate them.
When evaluating topics, be sure to consider:

* The assignment
* Your interests
* Your expertise
* The audience

**Topics that are more specific are nearly always better than general topics.** 

Topics to Avoid
===============

After many years of experience teaching Public Speaking, I've learned that there are some topics that rarely result in high-quality student work.
I **strongly** advise you to avoid the topics listed below.

Controversial or Political Issues 
---------------------------------

Examples include (but are not limited to):

- Gun Control
- Gay Marriage
- Abortion
- Euthanasia
- Death Penalty
- Marijuana
- Evolution
- Social Security
- Any Religious Belief
- Paying College Athletes
- Title IX
- Lowering the Drinking Age
  - Actually, anything to do with drinking (even "wine is good for you"). I'm tired of hearing about drinking.

Things People Already Know They Should or Should Not Do
-------------------------------------------------------

Examples include (but are not limited to):

- Getting Enough Sleep
- Wearing Seat Belts
- Regular Exercise
- Hand Washing
- Blood Donation
- Organ Donation
- Tobacco Use
- Drug Use
- Not Driving While Distracted (ex: Texting)
- Voting
- Anything About Diet, for example:
  - Eating Healthy Diets
  - Drinking more Water
  - Eating Breakfast[^nyt-breakfast-takedown-2016]
  - Eat This
  - Stop Eating This
- Any “Green” Topic, for example:
  - Recycling
  - Conserving Water
  - Conserving Electricity
  - Reducing Fuel Usage
  - The "Scary Chemical" Presentation[^way-dhmo]

Speech Topics That Are Not Creative or Unique
---------------------------------------------

Examples include (but are not limited to):

- The “Disease of the Week” Speech
- Nanotechnology
- Genetically Modified Foods
- Genetically Modified Organisms
- Vaccination
- Pet Adoption
- Animal Cruelty
- Animal Testing
- Fraternity/Sorority Speeches
