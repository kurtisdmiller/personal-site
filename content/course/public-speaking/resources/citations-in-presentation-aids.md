You should always cite your sources both in print and in prepared
presentations. Citing your sources significantly improves your credibility
and also protects you from committing plagiarism. When citing information
in a presentation, the citation should always appear in the same channel
as the information. For example, information you put on a slide should
have a citation on that slide and information you say aloud should be
accompanied by an oral citation. If you have information on a slide and
say it out loud, then there should be a citation in both channels. The
information on this page focuses on citations in presentation aids. I also
have a detailed resource on [Oral Citations in Presentations][]

This resource covers how to cite complete works (such as images, audio,
and video) and how to cite information only.

Citing Information in Presentation Aids
=======================================

There are many standardized ways to cite sources in print, and you should
pick one of these to use as part of any presentation aids that can include
print. The most commonly used style guides in academic writing are
published by the American Psychological Association (APA)[^APA] and the
Modern Language Association (MLA)[^MLA]. An addition widely used style
guide is the *Chicago Manual of Style*[^Chicago]. A variation of Chicago
Style designed specifically for students and scholars is also occasionally
encountered, and is commonly referred to by the last name of its
originator, Turabian[^Turabian]. The Online Writing Lab (OWL) at Purdue
University maintains a set of popular online resources for [APA][APA
Formatting and Style Guide], [MLA][MLA Formatting and Style Guide], and
[Chicago][Chicago Formatting and Style Guide] styles.

Information on Slides
---------------------

For visual aids that rely on slides, such as PowerPoint, it is usually
best to adapt citation requirements from an established style guide for
print, such as those discussed above. These typically only require minimal
adaptation. My standard advice is to use brief, in-text style citations on
your main slides, and use full citations in a set of reference slides at
the end.

First, place a brief, in-text style citation next to the information being
cited on the slide. If there is not enough space next to the information
it may be appropriate to footnotes within each slide. Second, place full
citations in their own dedicated references slide at the end of the
presentation. Use multiple reference slides if needed so that references
will be legible to your audience. There may be times when other approaches
are more appropriate, such as providing the full citation on each slide.

If you are citing information only this is all you need to do, but **if
you are citing a complete work, such as an image, you will need to do
more! Continue reading!**

Information on Handouts
-----------------------

For handouts, provide citations exactly as you would for a normal text
document. In order to conserve paper and improve visual appeal, you may
choose to place citations and references directly on the handout rather
than starting them in a separate section on a new page as most style
guides recommend.

Using Copyrighted Work in Presentation Aids
===========================================

For some types of work providing a citation isn't enough. Copyrighted
works belong to someone, and that person has the right to decide when and
how their work gets used. Citing the source of copyrighted work is not the
same as having permission to use the work. **Using copyrighted work,
including images, videos, and audio without permission (such as a license)
is usually illegal, even with citations,** unless that usage is permitted
under legal exemptions to the exclusive rights of copyright holders in all
applicable jurisdictions.

In the United States, the majority of these exemptions are listed in [17
U.S. Code Chapter
1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/chapter-1). As a student or
educator, many uses are permitted under **Fair Use**, described in [17
U.S. Code ยง 107](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107).

In my classes, I require students to explicitly identify the license or
source of their right to use a copyrighted work. **Fair Use should only be
identified as a source of this right in classes I teach when the work and
all similar works are not available under any free license and it legally
applies.** This is important practice for future employment.

Citing Images
-------------

**Taking images and using them without citation is plagiarism.** Images
should be cited in accordance with the requirements of the copyright
holder. In my classes I require citations for images to be accompanied by
a statement that identifies the source of the right to use the image. The
published APA style guide does not establish standards for a full citation
to use with images, but the APA Style Blog has published [examples of
citations for works of art][APA-image-citations].[^APA-image-citations]
Based on those examples, here is a sample the full citation for an image
that would go on a references slide:

 > Miller, K. D. (2016, October 14). *Outlining* [Digital Photograph].
 > Retrieved from https://www.flickr.com/photos/140911330@N07/29696952664/

Citing Audio
------------

You should provide a full oral citation either before or after an audio
presentation aid. Using only a printed citation for an audio presentation
aid is not appropriate because it does not match the channel of the
information.

Citing Video
------------

Video uses both audio and visual channels, and should be cited in both.

Citing Artifacts and Objects
----------------------------

Artifacts and objects typically do not require citations, but
acknowledgments of their source are often appreciated.
