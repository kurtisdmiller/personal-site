You should always cite your sources both in print and in prepared
presentations. Citing your sources significantly improves your credibility
and also protects you from committing plagiarism. When citing information
in a presentation, the citation should always appear in the same channel
as the information. For example, information you put on a slide should
have a citation on that slide and information you say aloud should be
accompanied by an oral citation. If you have information on a slide and
say it out loud, then there should be a citation in both channels. The
information on this page focuses on oral citations in a presentation.
I also have a detailed resource on the use of [Citations in Presentation
Aids][]

Oral Citations
==============

Unlike citations in print, where standards are well established, oral
citations are a bit trickier. They need to contain much of the same
information as print citations.

The First Time a Source is Cited
--------------------------------

The first oral citation to a source has the same function as the full
reference to the source that would go in a reference section at the end of
a paper. An oral citation should always include as much of the following
information as possible the first time that you cite it:

  * Author’s name
  * The author’s credibility (Who is this person? Why are they qualified
    on this subject?)
  * The type of source (Editorial, News Article, Book, TV Show, etc.)
  * Title of the piece (Article title, Book title, Episode title, etc.)
  * Title of what it is in (Title of Newspaper, Webpage, etc.)
  * The date that it was published
  * Every direct quotation should include a page number (or equivalent
    information)

For example:

  > Antoinette M. Burton, an American historian and Professor of History
  > and of Global and Transnational Studies at the University of Illinois,
  > argues that British influence became powerful in India due to the
  > British being successful pioneers in the industrial and technological
  > world in her 1994 book *Burdens of History: British Feminists, Indian
  > Women, and Imperial Culture, 1865–1915*.[^burton-1994]

Each Time the Source is Cited After
-----------------------------------

Then, whenever you bring up new information in the same source, you only
need to make sure we know where you got it, but you don’t need to give us
all of the same information again. These subsequent citations have the
same function as the brief in-text citations that go throughout a paper.
You can say things like:

  * "Burton's book also argues…"
  * “She goes on to say…”
  * “In the same article…”
  * “But Davis takes issue with this point…”
  * “Samir quotes Bill Clinton as saying ‘…’”
  * Remember: every direct quotation should include a page number (or equivalent)

Watch out for These Mistakes!
-----------------------------

  * Be certain you are citing the right thing. If someone is quoted in an
    article then you should say that they were quoted in the article – you
    should not cite them directly!
  * When you are putting citations in your outline or on your speaking
    notes[^citations-on-speaking-notes], you should write them as you
    would speak them during a presentation.
  * Don't leave out significant information.
  * *Always cite information in the same channel it is presented in*
    (spoken vs. on a presentation aid)
  * Make sure you don't place *all* of your citations in your visual aid.
  * Do not use the credibility statement in your introduction as an "oral
    reference section"
