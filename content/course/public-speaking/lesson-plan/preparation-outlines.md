# Outline of the Lesson

1.  Review of previous session's content
2.  Lesson opening
3.  Every presentation has three major sections:
    1.  Introduction
    2.  Body
    3.  Conclusion
4.  Types of Outlines
    1.  **Alphanumeric Outlines** vs. **Decimal Outlines**
    2.  **Full-sentence outlines** vs. **Topic Outlines**[^full-sentences-used]
5.  Outline Principles[^tardiff-brizee-2013-FourMain]
    1.  **Parallelism** (Writing all items in full sentences will fulfill this requirement.)
    2.  **Coordination** (All items at the same level should have the same level of importance.)
    3.  **Subordination** (Top-level items should be general and information deeper in the outline should be more specific.)
    4.  **Division** (Each item, if divided, should be divided into two or more parts.)
6.  Hands-on group work
    1.  Group students into groups of 5 students
    2.  Each group creates a full-sentence outline for a presentation about "how to do something" (15 minutes)
    3.  Groups revise the outline to follow the 4 outline principles (5 min)
    4.  Groups transfer the outline onto note cards (one full-sentence item per note card)
    5.  Groups shuffle the note cards and pass their presentation to another group
    6.  Groups re-construct an outline from the cards (10 min)
    7.  Groups fix problems with the outline (5 minutes)
7. Debrief the activity
8.  Lesson closing

# Limitations

This lesson requires students to use notebook paper and note cards.
Strategic grouping may be necessary for improved peer mentoring.

# Variations and Accommodations

Follow guidance from local accommodation authorities.
Students for whom writing by hand and moving physical objects will present an unreasonable burden may be accommodated if necessary.
Students may be placed in groups strategically if needed.
