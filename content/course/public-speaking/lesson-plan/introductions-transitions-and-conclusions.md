<!-- End Notes -->

[^full-circle]: A clincher that connects back to your introduction often works well, if you are having a hard time.
[^optional]: Summarizing your main points is optional. You should do this if you think the audience might have trouble remembering them, like if you had a lot, or if the presentation was long.
[^roadmap]: This is the "roadmap" or "preview" of your presentation. "I'll start off by talking about foo, then I'll explain bar."
[^signpost-examples]: Examples of signpost transitions include "First", "Next", and "In conclusion."
[^these-are-arguments]: Both your relevance statement and your credibility statement should really be called "arguments." You need to show your audience evidence that the topic is relevant and you are credible. Don't just say it!
[^this-does-both]: A directional transition includes both a summary and a preview. "Now that you've heard the main arguments in support of..., let's look at some of the counter-arguments."
