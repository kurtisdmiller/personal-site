**Course(s) Used:**

* Public Speaking

**Goals and Objectives:**

* Students can identify a variety of sources for images.
* Students can evaluate images for different uses.
* Students can create slides and handouts which incorporate images
  effectively.
* Students understand how to cite images.
* Students understand licensing and usage rights for copyrighted.
* Students can address accessibility concerns for images.

**Rationale:** Integrating images effectively is a vital part of
constructing a well-developed visual aid. Visual aids which use the
Assertion-Evidence Structure rely on images as one of their primary modes
of presenting visual evidence. Integrating images is an area that students
frequently struggle with.

Materials Needed
================

**Materials:**

* A computer with Internet access for demonstration

**Technology:**

* At least one computer with Internet access per group

Outline of the Lesson
=====================

1.  Review of previous session's content
2.  Lesson opening
3.  Open classroom discussion of why we need to use images
4.  Introduction of sources

    4.  Accessibility
7.  Using images in handouts or other presentation aids
    1.  Effects
    2.  Attribution
    3.  Licensing
    4.  Accessibility
8.  Hands-on group work
    * Students work in teams to create both a PowerPoint-style and
      a handout presentation aid. These should include at least three
      images that provide evidence for a clear assertion. They use
      personal computers to create these presentation aids and share them
      with the class when complete. Questions groups should answer in
      front of the class include:
        * "Where did you find your images?"
        * "What did you find most challenging about this project?"
        * "What do you think your visual aids do best?"
        * "What aspect of these visual aids could use the most improvement?"
9.  Lesson closing
