Limitations

This lesson only provides students with experience with two of the many
different types of special occasion presentation. Some students have
a difficult time coming up with awards for class members who are very
quiet. Keep an eye out for mean-spirited awards.

Variations and Accommodations

Follow guidance from local accommodation authorities. Students for whom
using paper and writing utensils to create an award certificate presents
an unreasonable burden will be accommodated on an individual basis.
Students may be placed in groups strategically if needed.
