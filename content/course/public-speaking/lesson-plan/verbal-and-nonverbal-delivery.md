# Outline of the Lesson

1.  Review of previous session's content
2.  Lesson opening
3.  View Phil Davison speech[^phil-davison]
4.  Delivery matters
    1.  If you don't look like you care, why should your audience care?
    2.  Boring presentations are the worst[^at-least-bad-is-interesting]
5.  Using note cards
    1.  Write on one side only
    2.  Number them
    3.  Use only key words, not full sentences (except references and direct quotes)
    4.  Start each new entry on a new line
    5.  Treat them as a "checklist" to make sure you don't forget something or jump around
    6.  Bring the cards up! Do not bring your face down.
    7.  Include additional information (reminders, positive talk, delivery cues)
    8.  Consider using colors to highlight transitions or other important parts
    9.  Mistakes to avoid:
        1.  Not using normal 3x5 index cards (unless you are a giant)
        2.  Using tiny scraps of paper as note cards
        3.  Using brightly colored note cards (difficult to see, and distract your audience)
        4.  Writing your entire presentation on them
        5.  Filling note cards with text
        6.  "I don't know what to do with my hands."
        7.  Throwing note cards when done with them (distracts your audience)
        8.  Reading them off of a table/podium (the whole point is that they can move with you)
