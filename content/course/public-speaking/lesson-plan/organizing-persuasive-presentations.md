**Course(s) Used:**

* Public Speaking

**Goals and Objectives:**

* Students can identify each of the common persuasive organization
  schemes.
* Students understand common mistakes for each organization scheme.
* Students can identify each of the stages in Monroe's Motivated Sequence.
* Students can create a presentation using Monroe's Motivated Sequence.

**Rationale:** Using a recognizable organization pattern through all of
the main points in a presentation makes it easier for the audience to
follow the presentation. Considering multiple organization patterns for
a topic often highlights different and more compelling approaches to the
presentation, and often more effective main points.

Materials Needed
================

**Materials:**

* Approximately 5 mundane objects that can be repurposed

**Technology:**

* None

to identify and exchange their own random mundane objects that they
brought with them rather than providing the objects.
