* Students understand how to analyze audiences, environments, and topics.
* Students learn the best ways to brainstorm topics.
* Students have a set of potential topics at the end of class.

**Rationale:** The best presentations occur when the audience, the
environment, and the topic all work together. Most of the time you can
only influence some of these factors. It is important to be able to

[^audience-perspective]: Think about context from the perspective of the audience. Where are they coming from? Where are they going next? What current events are they thinking about?
[^both-average-and-range]: When considering age, make sure you think about both the average age and the overall range of ages.
[^like-on-an-airplane]:  Help yourself first! If you aren't interested in it, I can guarantee no one else will be.
