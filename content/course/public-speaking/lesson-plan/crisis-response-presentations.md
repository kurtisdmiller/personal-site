**Course(s) Used:**

* Public Speaking

**Goals and Objectives:**

* Students can identify the principles of a good crisis response presentation.
* Students understand common mistakes made in crisis response presentations.
* Students experience producing a crisis response presentation.

**Rationale:** The speed of information has increased dramatically in our interconnected world.

Basic exposure to crisis response presentations is essential because members of organizations never know when they may need to be part of responding to a crisis.
