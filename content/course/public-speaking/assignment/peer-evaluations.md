Detailed Description
====================

Objective

Limitations
-----------

Format
------

**Traditional courses:** Your peer evaluation will be written on a note
card during each presentation. You will write a short paragraph or series
of bullet points containing feedback on their performance in your assigned
area of feedback. Students will be assigned to a topic for feedback
randomly from the following four options:

1. Assignment objective
2. Organization
3. Research and evidence
4. Delivery

**Online/Hybrid courses:** Your peer evaluation will be delivered as
a text post in a forum on the course management system website. You will
reply to the video linked by your partner with several paragraphs
addressing their performance in the presentation. You should write at
least one paragraph with multiple sentences addressing each of the
required sections:

1. Delivery Evaluation
2. Organization Evaluation
3. Research and Evidence Evaluation
4. Objective Evaluation
5. Other Comments

Grading
=======

Your peer feedback will be evaluated based on the quality and usefulness
of the feedback for the presenter. Peer feedback should demonstrate each
of the four principles of effective feedback:

1. Specific
2. Objective
3. Actionable
4. Paired (Balanced)
