**Overview:** You will deliver a presentation where you inform your
audience on a subject.

**Purpose:** All presentations benefit from using a variety of forms of
evidence from a variety of sources. This presentation provides a good
opportunity to practice finding and incorporating a variety of forms of
evidence from multiple sources and incorporating that information with
appropriate citations.

**Target Length:**  6 minutes

**Due:** See the calendar for your section for due dates.

Detailed Description
====================

Objective
---------

Locate an official US Federal, State, or Local Government report that is
about 20 pages long or longer. Prepare an informative presentation to
inform your audience on a subject **related to** key findings included in
this report. **You should not be summarizing the report**, you are only
using this report as **one source** of evidence to support **your**
informative argument, which should not be the same as the informative
argument this source is making.

Limitations
-----------

 * The report must be about 20 pages long or longer
 * The report must be less than 3 years old
 * You must include at least 2 additional sources
 * You must use a PowerPoint-style visual aid which uses the
   assertion-evidence structure

Format
------

Your presentation will be a live presentation delivered face-to-face in
front of your audience in an extemporaneous fashion. This format applies
to presentations delivered in-class and presentations [submitted by
video][Submitting Presentations by Video]. You should be practiced and
prepared for the presentation, but should not memorize the presentation or
read from a manuscript. You may use a key word/phrase outline on note
cards as speaking notes for this presentation if you will find them
helpful.

Grading
=======

This project is graded out of 150 points. 25 points come from the
preparation outline, 25 points come from the graded PowerPoint, and 100
points come from the presentation.

The outline portion of this assignment is worth 25 points. (Yes, you get
