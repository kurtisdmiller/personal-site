**Overview:** You will deliver a presentation where you inform your
audience on a subject.

**Purpose:** All presentations benefit from using a variety of forms of
evidence from a variety of sources. This presentation provides a good
opportunity to practice finding and incorporating a variety of forms of
evidence from multiple sources and incorporating that information with
appropriate citations.

**Target Length:**  6 minutes

**Due:** See the calendar for your section for due dates.

Detailed Description
====================

Objective
---------

Locate an official US Federal, State, or Local Government report that is
about 20 pages long or longer. Prepare an informative presentation to
inform your audience on a subject **related to** key findings included in
this report. **You should not be summarizing the report**, you are only
using this report as **one source** of evidence to support **your**
informative argument, which should not be the same as the informative
argument this source is making.

Limitations
-----------

 * The report must be about 20 pages long or longer
 * The report must be less than 3 years old
 * You must include at least 2 additional sources
 * You must use a PowerPoint-style visual aid which uses the
   assertion-evidence structure

Format
------

Your presentation will be a live presentation delivered face-to-face in
front of your audience in an extemporaneous fashion. This format applies
to presentations delivered in-class and presentations [submitted by
video][Submitting Presentations by Video]. You should be practiced and
prepared for the presentation, but should not memorize the presentation or
read from a manuscript. You may use a key word/phrase outline on note
cards as speaking notes for this presentation if you will find them
helpful.

Grading
=======

This project is graded out of 150 points. 25 points come from the
preparation outline, 25 points come from the graded PowerPoint, and 100
points come from the presentation.
