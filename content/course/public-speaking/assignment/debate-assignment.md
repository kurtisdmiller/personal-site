Task
====

You will conduct a debate as a team of three people against another team of three people.
You will have approximately 15 minutes to prepare before the debate.
Each presenter will be able to speak for a maximum of 4-minutes.
The debate will be delivered face-to-face in front of your audience.
You may use any notes you wish, as long as they have been prepared during the preparation time or during the debate itself.
You can select any approach within the theme for the round.
You do not need to include a presentation aid in these speeches.
**When you finish your presentation, the members of your audience should have been persuaded to vote in favor of your side.**

After preparation each member of the group will speak:
