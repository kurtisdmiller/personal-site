***This assignment is under construction***

**Overview:** You will conduct a debate as a team of three people against
another team of three people. You will have approximately 20 minutes to
prepare before the debate.

**Purpose:** Being an agile and confident speaker who can think on his or
her feet is beneficial. Practice in debate requires you to demonstrate the
majority of the learning outcomes for this course.

**Target Length:** 5 minute maximum, per speaker.

**Due:** See the calendar for your section for due dates.

Detailed Description
====================

Objective
---------

The debate consists of a series of persuasive speeches argued as a team.
You can select any approach within the theme for the round. You do not
need to include a presentation aid in these speeches. **When you finish
your presentation, the members of your audience should have been persuaded
to vote in favor of your side.**

Limitations
-----------
 * No new arguments may be presented in rebuttal speeches. 
 
Format 
------

Your presentation will be part of a live debate as a team against an
opposing team. The debate will be delivered face-to-face in front of your
audience in an extemporaneous fashion. You may use any notes you wish, as
long as they have been prepared during the preparation time or during the
debate itself. You and your team mate will have 20 minutes to prepare for
the debate with the assistance of some additional class members after the
topic is announced. After preparation each member of the group will speak:
