**Due Dates:**

  * See the calendar for your section for the available presentation dates.
  * Outline and Visual Aid -- two class meetings prior to your presentation.

Purpose
=======

Improvements in technology and the Internet have made mediated presentations increasingly common.
The ability to record and distribute a presentation electronically has made it far easier to reach a much greater number of people all over the world.
This presentation supports course student learning outcome #2.

Skills
------

In this assignment you will:

* Prepare a mediated presentation to be viewed asynchronously.
* Organize evidence to support an informative argument.

Knowledge
---------

This assignment will also help you become familiar with the following important content in this discipline:

* Differences between face-to-face and mediated presentations
* Historically significant figures in various fields of study

Task
====

You will prepare and deliver a 6-minute presentation where you inform your audience about a historically significant person in your major area of study.
"Historically significant" means that their actions have caused a significant change in that field.
If you have more than one declared major, choose a person from one of your major areas.
If you do not have a major area, choose someone who has had a historically significant impact on the field of [Communication Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_studies).
Do not choose a living person.
Do not choose your subject because they were famous or successful.
The person you choose may be outside your field of study, as long as they had an impact on that field.

To complete this assignment, you will need to:

1. Reserve a topic for your presentation on Moodle.
2. Create a preparation outline and submit it on Moodle.
3. Create a projected visual aid and submit it on Moodle.
4. Record your presentation.
5. Upload the recording to YouTube.
6. Submit the video URL on Moodle.

Here are some example outlines for mediated presentations given in this class.[^student-permission]

[Example Mediated Outline 1](/course/public-speaking/assignment/mediated-outline-example-1.docx) is a well-formatted outline.

[Example Mediated Outline 2](/course/public-speaking/assignment/mediated-outline-example-2.docx) does a very good job with using oral citations throughout the presentation.

Here is an [example of a visual aid](/course/public-speaking/visual-aid/example-visual-aid.pptx) that uses the Assertion-Evidence structure for each of the three forms of evidence which are commonly presented visually.
