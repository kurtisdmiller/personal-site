**Overview:** You will need to prepare a brief recorded presentation that can
be consumed anywhere in the world through using electronic media.

**Purpose:** More and more presentations occur through electronic media. The
ability to record and distribute a presentation electronically has made it far
easier to reach a much greater number of people all over the world. This
presentation allows you to edit and re-record portions of your presentation,
and allows you to present without the pressure of a live audience, which is
useful in helping new presenters overcome presentation anxiety.

**Target Length:** 7 minutes

**Due:** See the calendar for your section for due dates.

Detailed Description
====================

Objective
---------

Choose a historically significant person in your major area of study. Provide
an informative presentation that informs your audience about the events which
make this person historically significant to your future field. If you have
more than one declared major, choose a person from one of your major areas. If
you do not have a major area, choose someone who has had a historically
significant impact on the field of [Communication
Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_studies).

**Note:** "Historically significant" means that their actions have caused
a significant change in that field.  Many people who are historically
significant do not end up being famous or very successful. While some people
that are very successful in a field cause significant changes, many very
successful people are not historically significant to any field. Likewise,
while some people who are famous cause significant changes in a field, many do
not. Finally, remember that a person may change a field without being in that
field themselves.

Limitations
-----------

 * You should not choose someone who is currently active in their career.
 * You must use a PowerPoint-style visual aid which uses the assertion-evidence
   structure.
 
Format
------

You will need to record the presentation and save it in a commonly-used video
format in order to upload video to YouTube. Like all presentations, your
mediated presentation should include an effective introduction, body, and
conclusion.

Grading
=======

This project is graded out of 150 points. 25 points come from the
preparation outline, 25 points come from the graded PowerPoint, and 100
points come from the presentation.

[Example Mediated Outline

a well-formatted outline.

[Example Mediated Outline
2](/course/public-speaking/assignment/mediated-outline-example-2.docx)
does a very good job with using oral citations throughout the
presentation.

Here is an [example of a visual
aid](/course/public-speaking/visual-aid/example-visual-aid.pptx) that uses
the Assertion-Evidence structure for each of the three forms of evidence
which are commonly presented visually.
