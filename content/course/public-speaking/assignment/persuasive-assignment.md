Purpose

Persuasive presentations are one of the most important types of presentations.
Persuasion skills serve students throughout their lives.
This presentation supports general education student learning outcome #1 and course student learning outcome #1.

Skills

Task
====

You will prepare and deliver a 7-minute, face-to-face presentation where you persuade your audience.
You can select any topic you like, but keep in mind your audience and presentation environment (including the time available).
Make sure you choose a topic that will require a majority of your audience to change their behaviors and beliefs.
Be certain to include a specific proposal or call for action/change in your speech.
You must state this clearly so your audience knows exactly what you want of them.
When you finish your presentation, many of the members of your audience should have been persuaded to take the action you described in your call to action.

You must use Monroe's Motivated Sequence to organize your presentation.
You must use **at least two** presentation aids in your speech.
One presentation aid must be a PowerPoint-style visual aid which uses the **assertion-evidence structure.**
