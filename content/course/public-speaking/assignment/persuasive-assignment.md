**Overview:** You will deliver a presentation where you persuade your
audience on a subject.

**Purpose:** Using all the techniques and strategies you learned in class,
you will prepare and deliver a persuasive speech. Your speech should be
appropriate for a professional audience.

**Target Length:** 8 minutes

**Due:** See the calendar for your section for due dates.

Detailed Description
====================

Objective
---------

This is a persuasion speech. You can select any topic (remembering who
your audience is). Be sure that there is a specific proposal or call for
action/change in your speech. You must state this clearly so your
audience knows exactly what you want of them. Maintain a focus on this
proposal. When you finish your presentation, many of the members of your
audience should have been persuaded to take the action you described in
your call to action.

Limitations
-----------

 * You must use Monroe's Motivated Sequence to organize your presentation.
 * You must use **at least two** presentation aids in your speech.
   * One aid **must be** a PowerPoint-style visual aid which uses the
     **assertion-evidence structure.**
   * One aid may be **any other kind** of presentation aid.
 
Format
------

Your presentation will be a live presentation delivered face-to-face in
front of your audience in an extemporaneous fashion. This format applies
to presentations delivered in-class and presentations [submitted by
video][Submitting Presentations by Video]. You should be practiced and
prepared for the presentation, but should not memorize the presentation or
read from a manuscript. You may use a key word / phrase outline on note
cards as speaking notes for this presentation if you will find them
helpful.

Grading
=======

This project is graded out of 125 points. 25 points come from the
preparation outline and 100 points come from the presentation.
