The observation notes and interaction diagram will be scanned and turned in.

You will also write a report on what you observed.
The report should describe the meeting, connect at least two concepts discussed in class to that meeting, and include at least two recommendations for specific ways that the group could improve.
Your recommendations should be grounded in the content of the class.
The report should be two *FULL* pages of content, double-spaced, in APA format (7th Ed.).
