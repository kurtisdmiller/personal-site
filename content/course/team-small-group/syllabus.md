> **Course Description:**
> This class focuses on communication in small groups and teams.
> In order to further the students' understanding of these processes, a number of current theories and concepts will be introduced.
> Students will draw connections between these ideas, examples of the interactions of real world groups, and the students' own experiences.
> A number of group projects will be incorporated so that class members can have a chance to observe the phenomena and apply the strategies that are discussed in assigned readings and media, or which are presented in class.
> This class will require participation in group activities outside of the regularly scheduled class meetings.

*The syllabus for this course is subject to change at any time.*
*This includes, but is not limited to, such elements as required assignments, grading requirements/scales and the course calendar.*
*Updates will be communicated through the Moodle announcement system.*

Required Texts and Materials
----------------------------

The textbook for this course is "Communicating in Small Groups: Principles and Practices" (Beebe & Masterson).
We will be using the 10th Edition.
You will also need to bring standard classroom and note taking supplies with you each day.

Attendance and Participation
----------------------------

Attendance will be taken regularly.
Attendance records will be kept and reported to the extent required by law and university policy.
Participating regularly in class is assessed as a portion of your [Professionalism][] grade.

Late Work Policy
----------------

Late work may be turned in up to 1 calendar day after the deadline.
Late work will lose 10% of the available points.
Late preparation materials for prepared presentations may be turned in more than 1 calendar day after the deadline, but will earn zero points.
Prepared presentations may not be delivered if reasonably complete preparation materials have not been turned in at least 24 hours prior to the scheduled presentation time.
Late or missing work will also result in penalties to your [Professionalism][] grade.
Using technology is a basic expectation of students at this level of study -- issues with technology are not an excuse for late or missing work.
If you need assistance with technology, contact [Information Services][].

[Information Services]:     http://www3.tusculum.edu/is/

### Alternate Deadlines

In some rare cases an emergency may require you to miss class and turn in work after the assigned due date.
These situations are handled on a case-by-case basis and, depending on the situation and documentation, this work may be assigned an alternate deadline.
Coursework assigned an alternate deadline is graded for full credit, but will not receive feedback.

Alternate deadlines will not be assigned for absences that can be planned for -- this includes school-sponsored events, such as athletics.

## Classroom Behavior

We are a community of learners, and your classmates are entitled to the standard professional courtesies.
Show respect for every person in the classroom.
Complete your assigned work on time.
Be ready for classroom discussion and activities.
Ask questions.
Be supportive audience members.
Any member of an activity group should be prepared to present the work of the entire group.
Each student is required to conduct themselves in an appropriate manner at all times.
Racist, sexist, or other offensive or discriminatory language will not be tolerated.
Keep all devices (phones, tablets, laptops, headphones, etc.) out of sight, unless their use is required for a classroom activity.
Unprofessional behavior in the classroom will result in penalties to your [Professionalism][] grade.

Extra Credit may not be turned in after the last class meeting.

Email Policy
------------

Email is the primary and preferred method of communication for most student issues.
I check and respond to my email once daily, except weekends and holidays.

The privacy of student educational records is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).
I will not respond to any communication about a student which does not come from an official school email address.
I do not accept assignments by email.
Brief emails asking questions which are already answered in course documents (syllabus, calendar, assignment descriptions, etc.) may not receive a reply.

Engaging in professional communication with your professors and the university staff is important.
Some students benefit from the below email template, which comes from a post I wrote to help students with [writing professional emails][].
Whether you are in my class or any other class at the university, this template should work well. Just replace the information in brackets as needed:

[writing professional emails]: /post/writing-professional-emails/

> Subject: [class number and section]: [your issue]
> 
> Dear [Title Last Name  – if you can't find out, use "Professor" to be safe],
>
> I am in your [time] [class name] class on [days class meets].
> I have checked the [syllabus/assignment instructions/rubric/textbook/class resources] for an answer, but it does not adequately answer my question.
> I need some additional help with [your issue].
> 
> [Second paragraph explaining your question.
> Describe where you looked for answers, what you found, and how that information is not enough for you to have a clear answer to your question.
> You may also include other relevant aspects of your situation.]
>
> [OPTIONAL third paragraph where you propose answers or next steps.]
>
> Thank you,
>
> [Your First and Last Name]

Final Exam Policy
-----------------

A final exam is a required part of this course.
Final exams are administered only during three days of Final Exam Week in accordance with the established schedule.
Consult the syllabus and the Tusculum website to determine when your exams will take place and do not make travel, family, or any other plans that conflict with any of your final exams.
If you see that there will be an unavoidable conflict, drop this course before the Add/Drop period concludes and sign up for a different section.

Grade Disputes
--------------

If you believe that you have been graded unfairly, wait 24 hours after receiving the grade, review the rubric, and schedule a meeting to discuss it with me.
I will not discuss your grades publicly.
Come to this meeting prepared to provide evidence supporting the need for a grade change.
Grades are considered final one week after they are posted in Moodle.
