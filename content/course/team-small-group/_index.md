<!-- course description -->

**Course Description:** 
This class focuses on communication in small groups and teams.
In order to further the students' understanding of these processes, a number of current theories and concepts will be introduced.
Students will draw connections between these ideas, examples of the interactions of real world groups, and the students' own experiences.
A number of group projects will be incorporated so that class members can have a chance to observe the phenomena and apply the strategies that are discussed in assigned readings and media, or which are presented in class.
This class will require participation in group activities outside of the regularly scheduled class meetings.
