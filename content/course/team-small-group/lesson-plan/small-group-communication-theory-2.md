**Course(s) Used:**

**Goals and Objectives:**

* Students understand the investment model and how it predicts group membership
* Students are able to distinguish a group's value to a person and that person's satisfaction with the group

**Rationale:**
Although the textbook does not explain the Investment Model, it is one of the better models of voluntary association.

Materials Needed
================

**Materials:**

* None

**Technology:**

Outline of the Lesson
=====================

1.  Review of previous session's content
2.  Origin of the Investment Model
    1.  Origin in Economics and Consumer Psychology
    2.  Social Psychology
    3.  Interpersonal Communication
    4.  Team and Group Communication
3.  The Investment model predicts Stay/Leave behavior
    1.  Stay/Leave behavior is predicted by Commitment
    1.  Commitment is predicted by Satisfaction in Group[^social-exchange-theory], Perceived Quality of Alternatives[^includes-no-group], and Possible Losses
4.  Components of Satisfaction
    1.  Value (also called worth) = Reward - Costs
    2.  Satisfaction = Value - Expectations
5.  Components of Possible Losses
    1.  Intrinsic Investments
        1.  Benefits provided by the group
        2.  Efforts expended on the group
    2.  Extrinsic Investments
        1.  Benefits from being in the group (but not from the group)
        2.  Efforts expended because of the group (but not on the group)
6.  Lesson closing

<!-- TODO: add activity
3.  Hands on group work: "Brainstorm: fix a problem on campus"
    1.  Divide the class into groups of approximately 5.
    2.  Groups take turns discussing a problem on campus that they could create a product to solve.
    3.  While each group discusses, the other class members observe and create an interaction diagram.
    4.  Stop each group when they reach 7-10 minutes. Allow a few minutes between groups and at the end for discussion.
    5.  Discussion questions:
        1.  How did the interactions in the different groups differ?
        2.  What additional information could we add to the interaction diagram to make it more useful?

[^social-exchange-theory]: Social Exchange Theory speaks to this.
[^includes-no-group]: Comparisons with alternatives aren't just group-to-group. They may include multiple replacement groups or no group at all.

Limitations
