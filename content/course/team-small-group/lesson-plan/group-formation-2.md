**Course(s) Used:**

* Team and Small Group Communication

**Goals and Objectives:**

* Students can articulate the 5 stages of the Tuckman Model of group formation
* Students understand how to prepare an interaction diagram

**Rationale:**
Groups tend to go through similar stages, and being able to recognize and successfully navigate these stages is an important competency of a potential group member.
Students will need to know how to create an interaction diagram for their Community Group Observation assignment.

        2.  Only one team member may be in the rectangle at a time.
        3.  They may only touch one number at a time.
        4.  Team has 3 minutes to create a strategy.
        5.  Start timing when the number "1" is touched.
        6.  Tell students they will be able to ask yes-no questions when they return.
