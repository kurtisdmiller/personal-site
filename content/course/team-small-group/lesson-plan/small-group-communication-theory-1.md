**Course(s) Used:**

* Team and Small Group Communication

**Goals and Objectives:**

* Students gain familiarity with members of the class
* Students understand how to prepare an interaction diagram

**Rationale:**
Interaction diagrams are an important and accessible method of conducting small group observation work.
Students will need to know how to create an interaction diagram for their Community Group Observation assignment.

Materials Needed
================

**Materials:**

* None

**Technology:**

* Classroom computer and projector

Outline of the Lesson
=====================

1.  Review of previous session's content
2.  How to prepare an interaction diagram
    1.  Notate each group member[^might-be-a-number]
    2.  Draw a line for each communication event
        1.  Communication to the entire group is drawn away from the center.
        2.  Communication to a specific individual is an arrow form the sender to the receiver.
        3.  Add additional cross lines for subsequent communication events.
3.  Hands on group work: "Brainstorm: fix a problem on campus"
    1.  Divide the class into groups of approximately 5.
    2.  Groups take turns discussing a problem on campus that they could create a product to solve.
    3.  While each group discusses, the other class members observe and create an interaction diagram.
    4.  Stop each group when they reach 7-10 minutes. Allow a few minutes between groups and at the end for discussion.
    5.  Discussion questions:
        1.  How did the interactions in the different groups differ?
        2.  What additional information could we add to the interaction diagram to make it more useful?
4.  Lesson closing

[^might-be-a-number]: In normal observations this may be a name, a participant code/ID, a number, or a researcher nickname (ex: "Purple Pants")

Limitations
===========

At times this activity will require interruption to establish group member names.
