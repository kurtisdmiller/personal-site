The most important concern for a meeting agenda or for meeting minutes is that they accomplish their core function.
The core functions of minutes are to inform people who were not present of what happened at the meeting, and to serve as a record of what happened at the meeting if the group wants to look back.

Submitting minutes contributes 20 points to your grade.
Minutes will receive full credit if these minimum requirements are met.
If one item one item is missing (m) which impedes the core function of the minutes, it will receive 75% credit.
If it is missing two items, it will receive 50% credit.
If minutes are not submitted or the submitted minutes are severely lacking in content (missing 3 or more items), it will receive no credit.

Here is a convenient checklist of the required items:

| m | Objective                                                                                                                                                        |

| · | Who (by name) was at the meeting.                                                                                                                                |

| · | Each old business item which was revisited or finalized, with outcomes.                                                                                          |
| · | Each planned [new] business item for the meeting, time, and who presented it.                                                                                    |
| · | Each discussion item from the meeting, time, who led discussion, outcome (what did you decide), and outcome process (majority vote? consensus? coin flip? etc.). |
| · | Each decision item from the meeting, time, outcome, and outcome process.                                                                                         |
| · | A complete list of incomplete tasks with deadlines and responsible parties.                                                                                      |
| · | Date, Time, and Location of the next meeting.                                                                                                                    |

**Remember: Minutes are considered "turned in" when you upload them. They are due no later than 24 hours after the meeting they describe.**
