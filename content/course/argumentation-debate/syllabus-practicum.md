You will need paper and a writing utensil, a device for conducting research (phone, laptop, etc.), and a standard kitchen timer in every class meeting.

Attendance and Participation
----------------------------

----------------

Late work may be turned in up to 1 calendar day after the deadline.
Late work will lose 10% of the available points.
Late or missing work will also result in penalties to your [Professionalism][] grade.
Using technology is a basic expectation of students at this level of study -- issues with technology are not an excuse for late or missing work.
If you need assistance with technology, contact [Information Services][].

[Information Services]:     http://www3.tusculum.edu/is/

### Alternate Deadlines

In some rare cases an emergency may require you to miss class and turn in work after the assigned due date.
These situations are handled on a case-by-case basis and, depending on the situation and documentation, this work may be assigned an alternate deadline.
Coursework assigned an alternate deadline is graded for full credit, but will not receive feedback.

Alternate deadlines will not be assigned for absences that can be planned for -- this includes school-sponsored events, such as athletics.

## Classroom Behavior

We are a community of learners, and your classmates are entitled to the standard professional courtesies.
Show respect for every person in the classroom.
Complete your assigned work on time.
Be ready for classroom discussion and activities.
Ask questions.
Be supportive audience members.
Any member of an activity group should be prepared to present the work of the entire group.
Each student is required to conduct themselves in an appropriate manner at all times.
Racist, sexist, or other offensive or discriminatory language will not be tolerated.
Keep all devices (phones, tablets, laptops, headphones, etc.) out of sight, unless their use is required for a classroom activity.
Unprofessional behavior in the classroom will result in penalties to your [Professionalism][] grade.

Email Policy
------------

Email is the primary and preferred method of communication for most student issues.
I check and respond to my email once daily, except weekends and holidays.

The privacy of student educational records is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).
I will not respond to any communication about a student which does not come from an official school email address.
I do not accept assignments by email.
Brief emails asking questions which are already answered in course documents (syllabus, calendar, assignment descriptions, etc.) may not receive a reply.

Engaging in professional communication with your professors and the university staff is important.
Some students benefit from the below email template, which comes from a post I wrote to help students with [writing professional emails][].
Whether you are in my class or any other class at the university, this template should work well. Just replace the information in brackets as needed:

[writing professional emails]: /post/writing-professional-emails/

> Subject: [class number and section]: [your issue]
> 
> Dear [Title Last Name  – if you can't find out, use "Professor" to be safe],
>
> I am in your [time] [class name] class on [days class meets].
> I have checked the [syllabus/assignment instructions/rubric/textbook/class resources] for an answer, but it does not adequately answer my question.
> I need some additional help with [your issue].
> 
> [Second paragraph explaining your question.
> Describe where you looked for answers, what you found, and how that information is not enough for you to have a clear answer to your question.
> You may also include other relevant aspects of your situation.]
>
> [OPTIONAL third paragraph where you propose answers or next steps.]
>
> Thank you,

Final Exam Policy
-----------------

Grade Disputes
--------------

If you believe that you have been graded unfairly, wait 24 hours after receiving the grade, review the rubric, and schedule a meeting to discuss it with me.
I will not discuss your grades publicly.
Come to this meeting prepared to provide evidence supporting the need for a grade change.
Grades are considered final one week after they are posted in Moodle.
