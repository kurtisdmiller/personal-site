**Course(s) Used:**

* Interpersonal Communication

**Goals and Objectives:**

* Students can describe the transactional model of communication.
* Students can list characteristics that separate Interpersonal Communication from other types of communication.

**Rationale:** This lesson lays the foundation for the study of
communication as a field, the location of interpersonal communication
within that field, and the major concepts used in modeling the process of
communication.

Materials Needed
================

**Materials:**

* None

**Technology:**

* Classroom computer and projector

Outline of the Lesson
=====================

1.  Review of previous session's content
2.  A hard question: "What is Communication?"
    1. Transactional (a coordinated action, like dancing)
    2. Intentional *or* Unintentional
    3. Irreversible
    4. Unrepeatable (Neither you, them, nor the situation are the same)
    5. Includes Content *and* Relationship dimensions
3.  Misconceptions about Communication
    1. Communication doesn't always promote understanding.
    1. Communication isn't always beneficial.
    2. Not all problems can be solved by communicating.
    3. Communication is a learned skill, not a natural ability.
4.  What makes communication "Interpersonal"?
    1. Unique. It is customized according to who is involved.
    2. Interaction is interdependent.
    3. Interpersonal messages involve self-disclosure.
    4. Interpersonal communication is *intrinsically rewarding*.
5.  Significant models of Communication[^va-ip1]
    1. Aristotelian Model[^aristotle-nd]
        1. The oldest model known, circa 300 BCE.
        2. Doesn't really focus on most communication.
        3. A transmission model.
    2.  Bell's Model[^bell-nd]
        1. Inserting technology into interpersonal communication motivated study on its process.
        2. Studies communication from the perspective of another field (engineering).
        3. A transmission model.
    3.  Shannon's Model[^shannon-1948]
        1. Builds on Bell's model.
        2. A transmission model.
        3. One of the most famous models of communication.
    4.  Lasswell's Model[^lasswell-1948]
        1. Unique because of its memorable sequence of phrases.
        2. A transmission model.
    5.  Schramm's Model[^schramm-1954]
        1. The first model that included a concept of different perspectives in the model.
        2. Still a transmission model.
    6.  Osgood & Schramm's Model[^osgood-schramm-1954]
        1. The first model that displayed communication as an ongoing, reciprocal process.
    7.  Berlo's Model[^berlo-1960]
    8.  Transactional Model[^barnlund-1970]
        1. Barnlund's model has spawned several transactional models, but these are the dominant form used today.
6. Hands on group work
7. Lesson closing
