Reading through scientific articles can be difficult, but it is
a rewarding practice. Reading scientific research effectively requires
going through the same article multiple times. The infographic below from
Elsevier is a really good summary of how to do this, and I have a few
additions to this advice:

1. Write down questions you have on the print out as you go (including
   definitions to look up).
2. Write down answers you find to these questions (including the actual
   definitions).
3. Use a different color pen and highlighter each time you read through
   (so 3 colors total).
4. Plan to spend 2-4 hours total across at least two different days doing
   this.
    * Use day 1 for steps 1 & 2
    * Look up answers you can't get from the article
    * Use day 2 for steps 3 & 4
