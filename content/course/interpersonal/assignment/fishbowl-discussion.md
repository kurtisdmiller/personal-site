Detailed Description
====================

Objective
---------

Select a chapter from the textbook and choose one Interpersonal
Communication theory presented in that chapter. Select two original
research articles from the Communication literature which use that
theory. Upload PDF copies of these articles to Moodle. Read and
[annotate](/course/interpersonal/assignment/annotating-articles/) both
articles. Turn in printed out [annotated
copies](/course/interpersonal/assignment/annotating-articles/) of the
sources you chose. Provide a short summary of the articles in class and
participate in discussion with the panel about your chosen papers, how
they connect with the other papers presented, what they say about the
topic of the class meeting, and how what we can learn from the papers
can be applied in daily life.

Limitations
-----------

-   Both articles you choose must have a "Results" section.

Format
------

Each presenter will provide a brief overview of the contents of the
articles they chose. Presenters will then engage in discussion about
their articles and how they inform one another. Questions from the
audience are encouraged, but generally should not start until all of the
presenters have had a chance to contribute to the overall discussion.

Grading
=======

This project is graded out of 100 points.
