Differences in National Culture
===============================

Geert Hofstede's six dimensions of national culture

---

Hofstede's Research identifies 6 dimensions
-------------------------------------------

* Collectivism vs. Individualism
* Power Distance
* "Masculinity vs. Femininity"
* Uncertainty Avoidance
* Long-term Orientation
* Indulgence

---

Collectivism vs. Individualism
------------------------------

> Individualism is the extent to which people feel independent, as opposed
> to being interdependent as members of larger
> wholes.[^hofstede-2019-online]

Power Distance
-------------

> Power Distance is the extent to which the less powerful members of
> organizations and institutions (like the family) accept and expect that
> power is distributed unequally.[^hofstede-2019-online]

"Masculinity vs. Femininity"
----------------------------

> Masculinity is the extent to which the use of force in endorsed
> socially.
> Men are supposed to be from Mars, women from Venus. Winning is important
> for both genders. Quantity is important and big is beautiful. In
> a feminine society, the genders are emotionally closer. Competing is not
> so openly endorsed, and there is sympathy for the
> underdog.[^hofstede-2019-online]

> and ambiguity.[^hofstede-2019-online]

Long-term Orientation
---------------------

> In a long-time-oriented culture, the basic notion about the world is
> that it is in flux, and preparing for the future is always needed. In
> a short-time-oriented culture, the world is essentially as it was
> created, so that the past provides a moral compass, and adhering to it
> is morally good.[^hofstede-2019-online]

Indulgence
----------

> In an indulgent culture it is good to be free. Doing what your impulses
> want you to do, is good. Friends are important and life makes sense. In
> a restrained culture, the feeling is that life is hard, and duty, not
> freedom, is the normal state of being.[^hofstede-2019-online]
