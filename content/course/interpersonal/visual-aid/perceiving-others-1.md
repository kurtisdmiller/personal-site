Attribution Theory Exercise[^robinson-2017-CT]
===========================

---

Interaction #1
--------------

Your professor has assigned groups for an upcoming project. You end up in the same group as Jane, one of your classmates.

---

Interaction #2
--------------

Today, Jane is 10 minutes late to your third group meeting. She missed the first two meetings. When Jane arrives, she exclaims "I'm so sorry I'm late--I promise it won't happen again!" As the meeting progresses, it becomes clear that Jane didn't prepare at all--none of her work is done!

---

Questions
---------

1.  Why do you think Jane missed the first two meetings?
2.  What is your reaction to Jane's apology and claim?

---

Interaction #3
--------------

Thee days later, you have your fourth group meeting. The meeting started 30 minutes ago, and Jane hasn't arrived yet.

---

Questions
---------

1.  Why do you think Jane isn't here yet?
2.  What is your evaluation of Jane? Why?
